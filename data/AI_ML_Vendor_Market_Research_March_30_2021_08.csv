For the last 11 years, we have been an innovator in developing and applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies to the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and Missile Defense Agency, as well as to civilian agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy. We summarize here our AI/ML work that the Army could leverage with a limited additional dollar investment to apply to battlefield uses.
Much of our AI/ML work to create battlefield-related systems has been funded under multiple Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program contracts, including a Rapid Innovation Fund contract to transition to the U.S. Navy, and two 5-year Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contracts from the Office of Naval Research with a 3rd pending award. We have received many awards, including the prestigious Tibbetts Award twice (2007 and at the White House in 2013) for technology innovation for the U.S. Navy for transitioning of SBIR technology to the Navy DDG-1000 Zumwalt destroyer and all Littoral Combat Ships. Our Commercialization Index from the Department of Defense, a peer rating of SBIR companies with Phase II contracts, is 95, well above the average of 15-20 for most of the companies.
Harmonia is a trusted partner with the U.S. Navy Program Management Warfare (PMW) 150 with whom we have been working to create a new generation of intelligent Command/Control (C2) systems, including an Automated Battle Management Aid (ABMA), the Statistical Exploitation of Every Lesson By Learning and Uncovering Exemplars (STEELBLUE) system to anticipate Enemy Courses of Action (ECOAs), and the Situational Assessment using Pedigree, Probability, and Heuristics in Reduction of Entities (SAPPHIRE) system to vigilantly discover and rate information from diverse sources related to a mission. 
In this work, we have been implementing a microservice-based AI/ML architecture to enable scalability and interoperability. We use AI/ML methods across our project such as neural networks, genetic algorithms (GA), plan-goal graphs, case-based reasoning (CBR), classification methods (e.g., anticipatory learning classifier systems, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). We also work with the Navy on establishing an open and non-proprietary Generalized AI Framework (GAIF), which integrates our systems with others, but the Government controls the architecture.
We have applied the NLP methods in SBIR work for the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) to analyze a document corpus to derive “stories” or chains of evidence that relate entities and concepts in the documents beyond what normal link analysis does. We furthermore developed a delivery mechanism to small units in battlefield uses of mobile devices through the Tactical Edge Developer (TED) system, also for CERDEC under Rapid Innovation Funds. TED enables warfighters to design/compose mobile apps from a library of components, and AI/ML components that could be incorporated into such a library.
Although Harmonia has pushed the state of the art for C2 and battle management applications of AI/ML, Harmonia has a culture of using repeatable processes and an emphasis on quality to ensure that any Science and Technology (S&T) products we develop, can be transitioned to operational systems. Those processes are embodied by Harmonia being ISO 9001:2015, 20000-1:2011, and 27001:2013 certified as well as Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 appraised in service and Agile-based development.

STEELBLUE (SB)
We conceptualized, developed, integrated, and delivered to the Navy an applied AI/ML solution called SteelBlue (SB). SB pushes the state of the art to create AI/ML in a 100% automated manner reflecting how an adversary through cognitive reasoning would formulate the most likely and most dangerous Enemy Course Of Action (ECOA) that a Naval Commander may encounter during operations. Notably, and again pushing the state of the art, SB operates under the client-defined conditions of uncertainty in the intelligence information sources used as input sources.
We identified the required AI/ML tasks for development of the SB tool and worked with Navy stakeholders to develop and implement these capabilities and processes. We created a customized Genetic Algorithm (GA) to mimic inventiveness of an adversary in creating potential incidents that out-think U.S. forces as our Navy is presented with previously unseen situations.  We utilized Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) to perform AI/ML to build up and rank previously seen ECOAs, and during a hostile situation the CBR provided initial conditions for the GA and kept the total running time under 60 seconds since time is precious in a conflict. This application of an AI is unique, pushing the state of the art. SB was installed in an operating environment on the U.S.S. Carl Vinson aircraft carrier for use in 2018, with that success leading to pending installation at Commander of the Third Fleet in 2019. Our use of a GA has allowed us to streamline the decision process by having SB provide commanders with different decision options from which the commander can quickly select one. In addition, using Course of Action (COA) to populate the initial variables has reduced duplication of work in input of initial parameters. We have also provided training to Navy stakeholders on the SB algorithms and its decision making criteria so adjustments can be made by the team in the future as necessary. We utilize a continuous improvement process where we analyze all SB decision recommendations to see if the defined business processes/rules/algorithms are operating as expected within the defined parameters.
1.2. Situational Assessment Using Pedigree, Probability, and Heuristics in Reduction of Entities (SAPPHIRE)
We developed an applied Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solution for a new generation of intelligent Command & Control (C2) systems for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). The ONR Command Decision Making (CDM) organization funded the work. We worked with Navy and USMC stakeholders to develop a solution to support their mission of advancing cognitive theory and computational modeling to create decision support tools for warfighters, human decision modeling and intent inferencing, machine facilitated team (human) collaboration, knowledge creation, and transfer.
We have improved existing AI capabilities by enabling in SAPPHIRE, semantic machine understanding and collection of documents without human intervention (thereby reducing work), which if applied to DIA could achieve a 10x reduction in the time for knowledge workers to discover information relevant to financial/occupational health/logistics business areas.
We created the SAPPHIRE system, in which a user (e.g., warfare commander) describes their situation in English using natural language (e.g., conduct humanitarian rescue after natural disaster where little information exists). SAPPHIRE applies AI to autonomously monitor and mine multiple information sources (e.g., private data lakes, public Internet sites) to discover new information sources and provide, score, and prioritize (score) relevant information to the user based on defined business processes/rules/algorithms by our team. 
SAPPHIRE additionally applies AI to minimize the transfer of information across military networks to satisfy the circumstances of intermittent and low bandwidth networks, which affects the employment of capabilities. To minimize data transfers, we applied AI for semantic interpretation and inference to create a model of data across data lakes that we call an Information Topology Map (ITM). The ITM is a model that contains high probability knowledge about what information exists in which data lakes, and how it is changing.  The ITM is key in our method to minimize information transfer across networks: the ITM is consulted as an oracle rather than sending messages back and forth to distant data lakes. Because ITM is on the same network as the warfare commander using the data, no network bandwidth is consumed.
SAPPHIRE applies AI methods to automatically evaluate when information in data lakes or web sites becomes outdated and should no longer be returned to users. We apply LSTM neural networks for machine understanding of English text in unstructured documents, meta tagging with Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples stored in the ITM, and performing semantic inference on the triples, along with k-means clustering, and fuzzy matching, to enable machine understanding of natural language. We NLP methods such as parts of speech tagging, entity and key-phrase extraction, importance ranking, and content summarization. 
To facilitate conceptualization and user feedback, we in our initial agile sprints, developed draft storyboards illustrating Navy missions as scenarios, the operation of SAPPHIRE (where AI would act, for example to autonomously constructed an ITM), and mocked up the user interface (UI) seen by different personas. Though user-centered design with Navy and USMC personnel we evolved a highly intuitive UI requiring zero training. Final storyboards then led to building and evaluating prototypes. 
We used prototype software to build test models for evaluation on operationally derived data to predict the accuracy of automation and other system performance measures. Utilizing our CMMI processes and a DevSecOps pipeline with test automation on Red Hat OpenShift, we applied quality and security verification to enable transition into the production system.
For delivery we performed the Risk Management Framework, applying secure technical implementation guidelines (STIGs) to harden our system, and documenting scan results to obtain an Interim Authority to Operate. Our Sapphire implementation of AI was flexible to support Navy Denied—Disconnected, Intermittent, and Limited (D-DIL) networks (where the network disappears intermittently without warning) and USMC low bandwidth ashore networks.
1.3. Automated Battle Management Aid (ABMA)
ABMA is an applied AI Naval Planning command and control applied AI tool designed to help planners to extremely shorten the time to make force composition recommendations to fulfill the assets needed to perform a required mission.  It reduces the time it takes to determine force allocations accurately from days and weeks to seconds and minutes using our AI technologies. 
Our ABMA efforts originally started with a high risk/high payoff Navy SBIR research project Phase I project to improve AI/ML methods for Navy use.  We worked with Navy stakeholders to identify processes that would benefit from the implementation of AI decision making. Our current ABMA contract is from the highly competitive DoD Rapid Innovation Fund (RIF) for deployment.  
ABMA is an AI/ML-based planning and analysis tool implementing GA and CBR AI capabilities. ABMA enables Naval Planners the ability to rapidly develop multiple US Naval COAs and to compare and adjust alternatives (thereby reducing duplication of work in multiple scenarios) through an iterative planning process that, when completed, provides the optimal COAs based upon the current situation and circumstances that a Naval force is encountering or what the Naval force plans on encountering in the future. ABMA was installed on the U.S.S. Carl Vinson aircraft carrier for use in Summer 2018 during the operational exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC 2018), with that success leading to installation at C3F in 2019. ABMA is a breakthrough technology that will also enable Naval planners to analyze conceptual data models for different decisions and redevelop COAs during battle through defined business processes/rules/algorithms and provide decision recommendations to commanders at the height of execution when human cognizance and rational are highly stressed.

This evaluation was presented to the IMCEN Chief of Oversight and Plans and then to the Director IMCEN.  Director IMCEN indicated that IMCEN-PM should proceed with an expanded pilot project on 450 workstations in cooperation with other IMCEN/ITA elements, such as Customer Support and Information Assurance.  The PreDix expanded pilot project successfully demonstrated its ability to detect, correlate and analyze problem trends across user workstations and aid in the repair of errors on user workstations.
PreDix uses unique root cause analysis techniques to automatically detect desktop anomalies, diagnose the root cause and either automate repair or provide information needed for a rapid, precise diagnosis from the support team.  Knowledge regarding a successful diagnosis is automatically shared across the IMCEN support team.  PreDix integrates with other desktop management systems to improve the overall support effectiveness of the enterprise network.  IMCEN completed the PreDix pilot demonstration on 30 March 2007, and recommended proceeding into this follow-on full production deployment and implementation of PreDix across all agencies within the Pentagon with high priority.

The CARIS Mira AI platform provides capabilities across three dimensions: one-dimensional time series, two-dimensional grids, and three-dimensional clouds. For each application, we leverage the latest advancements in Deep Learning and other Machine Learning fields to provide superior performance. By providing these tools as a Cloud service, we have the capability to rapidly deploy and update these services on an ongoing basis.

The first commercial service offering on the CARIS MIRA AI platform is the Sonar Noise Classifier, which is a trained Convolutional Neural Network optimized to identify noise in 3D point clouds generated by acoustic sensor platforms. All data goes through a pre- and post-processing stage to form the data into something the AI will understand: the data is rasterized into a high-resolution 3D voxel grid (zero-origin) before being transmitted to the Deep Learning Model for inference. Besides re-sampling the data into a format the AI can understand, this also has a side-benefit of completely anonymizing the data, as all spatial information is stripped during the voxelization process before transmission. When the classified voxels are returned from the AI, we post-process the data and map the results back to individual points to continue processing.",https://www.teledynecaris.com/en/products/caris-mira-ai/,F_d4sdHlSzst3rJiF,Deep+Learning-+Applications+for+Multibeam+Survey (1).pdf,1081940,application/pdf,Software?,"Local/County,State,Federal,Environmental/Natural Resources,Other","Maritime, Marine Survey, Oceanographic","Local/County,State,Federal,Energy,Environmental/Natural Resources,Transportation,Utilities,Other","Maritime, Marine Survey, Oceanographic",Generally available,,"Cost savings,Process efficiency improvement,Increase in quality of decision making",,,,"Federal government,State/Local government, describe",Port of Long Beach,,,Other,"Data Aggregation/Analytics/Reporting,GIS",,"Neural Networks,Predictive Analytics,Data Aggregation/Assimilation/Visualization",,"Optimization,Cleaning and preparation,Geospatial,Deep learning",,No,,"Full version is available only as a standard, supported commercial product,Cost based upon usage,Other",Cloud based or on premises.

We do not invent new technology so much as apply existing technology to a specific customer problem.",No,VIBE,"Global Alliant's (GA) VIBE is an artificial intelligence learning platform for managing IT operations and automating simple-to-highly complex business and IT processes. VIBE transforms virtually any repetitive manual task into an automated, digitized solution for rapid processing and scenario-based real-time data capture from multiple sources at the same time. We see VIBE offering CCSQ real benefits in targeting possible business processes for automation. VIBE's data capture with Artificial Intelligence identifies the right automated actions to perform at the right time and does so using existing toolsets. Besides centralized automation, VIBE offers advanced machine learning (ML), BPML 2.0 compatibility, and event-driven modeling. VIBE's native AI framework allows build capabilities using optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), and other AI/ML libraries.  VIBE is highly flexible and deployable as an on-premises, cloud, or hybrid solution and integrates chatbot with enterprise applications to deliver 24/7 assistance. VIBE's Business Process Engine (BPE) provides seamless routine task automation and integration with other tools and platforms through APIs. As a GA customer example, a large insurance company was using many homegrown and third-party tools to collect plenty of data. They did not have a single tool to analyze data from various sources and take automated actions based on scenarios. There was a need to reduce/lower outage time. GA's AIOps VIBE Platform was able to analyze the existing data by ingesting multiple sources and using AI to perform automated actions. This helped the organization save over 12,000 outage minutes in that year based on the successful implementation of GA's AIOps VIBE Platform.",www.globalalliantinc.com,,,,,Software?,"Communications and Technology,Consumer Services,Insurance,Local/County,State,Federal,Utilities",,"Communications and Technology,Consumer Services,Local/County,State,Federal,Utilities",,Generally available,,"Cost savings,Process efficiency improvement,Aggregate and assimilate complex data",,,,"Private sector, describe",,,,,"Supply Chain,Logistics,Business Process Management,Customer Experience,Data Aggregation/Analytics/Reporting",,"Machine Learning,Data Aggregation/Assimilation/Visualization,Robotic Process Automation",,"Structured,Unstructured,Exploratory Data Analysis,Regression, Classification & Clustering,Visualization,Dashboards & charts,Supervised,Unsupervised,Natural language processing,Robotics",,"Yes, describe",Java,Cost based upon usage,,,Requires services engagement with us,,"AWS,AWS GovCloud,Azure,Azure Government,On-premise or private cloud",,Yes,EXE,,"Linux,Windows",,"None,None",,,,,,Yes,No,No,,,,,No,,,,"Encryption at rest,Encryption in motion","Yes, describe",Because AI learns the system better,"Customer site,USA",,Yes,Yes,"ServiceNow, Splunk, SalesForce","ServiceNow, Splunk, SalesForce",Yes,Free online training/webinars,,Low (1 - 5 days),Low (1 - 5 days),Yes,No,,"Software Engineer,Systems Engineer,Infrastructure Engineer,Systems Administrator","Infrastructure Engineer,Systems Administrator",Online web pages/books,,"FISMA,High,Section 508 compliant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Consumer Services,Local/County,State,Federal,Utilities",,"Communications and Technology,Consumer Services,Insurance,Local/County,State,Federal,Education,Transportation,Utilities",,"Natural Language Processing ,Machine Learning ,Predictive Analytics ,Data Aggregation/Assimilation/Visualization ,Robotic Process Automation ,AI Framework Tool ,Machine Vision,Optimization",,"Business Process Management,Fraud,Data Aggregation/Analytics/Reporting,Customer Experience,Call Center Performance",,"Cost savings,Process Efficiency Improvement,Decrease in Low Value Work,Increase in quality of decision making based on data outcomes",,"AI Strategy,AI Roadmap and Planning,Prototyping,Experiment Design,Model Development,Model Reuse,ModelOps,MLOps,DataOps ,Insights Generation,Application Integration,Automation Through RPA,Application Scaling,Performance Engineering,Change Management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(T&T) has supported the Dept. of Defense (DoD), Defense Health Agency (DHA) by developing Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms and innovative Machine Learning solutions.

Specifically, we provide the DHA Vision Center of Excellence (VCE) with NLP development for the Defense and Veterans Eye Injury and Vision Registry (DVEIVR) database.

DVIEVR is a joint initiative between the DoD and Veterans Affairs (VA) to manage an ocular care clinical data repository, to allow for DoD and VA clinical providers and researchers to review and research data collected on eye care diagnosis, surgical intervention, operative procedures, visual acuity, and treatment of our service members and veterans.

​Prior to T&T’s efforts on the DVEIVR project, data was pulled from records of various healthcare systems and data stores, and data abstractors would utilize structured text records, as well as unstructured text fields, to fill in patient records for the DVEIVR database. They would scour thousands of records per month looking for every instance of an eye injury or treatment, to log the data in the appropriate screen/field in DVEIVR. This approach is very timely and prone to errors, especially as new abstractors are becoming familiar with appropriate vision terminology.

In an effort to improve accuracy and to help abstractors find potential injury and treatment data faster, T&T was contracted to design NLP application program interface (API) tools. The intent of these tools was to analyze DVEIVR free text data fields using NLP over the network and produce de-identified enriched data that could be used by programmers at any point in the system. The APIs were to be developed based on a common framework acceptable between the T&T developers and the DVEIVR master system integrator.

T&T developed a Machine Learning Engine to analyze highly jargonized medical text. Using complex NLP algorithms, the engine interprets words and data in context and can then feed webforms that can be used for data analysis, trend analysis, and even auditing of records. As NLP interprets clinical data to assist abstractors, those abstractors can approve or disapprove NLP’s work when documenting medical providers’ notes into data and information for researchers. Our Machine Learning engine yields excellent results with accuracy that our team is continuously improving during this ongoing project.


T&T’s NLP Team has made considerable strides in implementing advanced technology on DVEIVR where other contractors failed. Our team of data scientists, NLP developers, and functional analysts laid the groundwork for developing and integrating NLP algorithms and machine learning web services with the DVEIVR database, which will allow for more efficient processing of medical record free text data, to improve the capacity of our clinicians and researchers to locate and compile a greater amount of relevant data to their database queries. This advanced technology not only reduces human error introduced to the database through the use of Clinical Data Abstractors, but can also be used in the future to perform automated data cleansing and data quality activities.

We have developed configurable business analytics and reporting components and dashboards, along with custom situational awareness analytics views built with Cesium, ReGraph, AG-Grid, React, and D3, specifically for viewing and sense-making of complex structured and relational data. These custom visualizations will fuse and display data with interactive controls that enable administrators and key stakeholders to search, analyze, and optimize for optimal care team coordination and virtual ward resource allocation. NETCCN dashboard components will be designed to be reused between disaster relief solutions as we have established a clear development workflow and a growing library of disaster-agnostic visualizations that can be rapidly applied to a common data schema. 

Expression will build and present graph-based network views of NETCCN virtual ward and care team organizational data. Understanding human capital is a multi-level complex systems task, and thus an ideal use case for utilizing graph-based mathematical visualization methods and network science modeling. Each network-based data view informed by machine learning critical alerts and recommendations will enable users to better understand and empirically capture how NETCCN care teams and virtual wards evolve and change through time and how the structure of these personal and organizational care networks affect patient outcomes, enterprise readiness, unit strength, team composition, stress on the teams, and predict patient care trajectories. React, D3, and ReGraph will be used to represent these data in interactive layered graph views for administrators and users to improve response, patient care, and relational coordination enabling a more automated and rigorous, continuous quality improvement lifecycle.

ETL / ELT Processes and Technologies 

Expression Networks’ will utilize both Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) and Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) process methodologies within our data lifecycle pipelines. Our data processing layer is open source and includes Azure EventHub (Apache Kafka), Azure HDInsight (Apache Spark), Azure SQL (Postgres), and Azure Databricks and Delta Lake for consumption and transformation of data from current and historical structured and unstructured sources into a single Authoritative Data Source (ADS) across our data ecosystem. For tasks within the NETCCN OCA that are better suited for high compute and structured data for instance, from patient HL7 FHIR resources, ETL to PostgreSQL will be used. Conversely ELT to Azure Delta Lake will be used for big unstructured streaming data and batch data ML workloads. The primary data transfer formats will include standard CSV, JSON, or SQL. 

Azure Delta Lake processes both batch and streaming data and can infer schema from input data reducing the amount of time spent dealing with the impact of changing business needs at multiple levels of our pipeline and data stack. Upon ingestion, ML data will be normalized, standardized, fused, and cleaned transformed as one phase inside our Delta Lake. For network-based machine learning, an additional graph processing layer will transform organizational and structured data into the appropriate graph domain models and adjacency matrices. These data will be initially stored in Azure CosmosDB and transformed in Spark for machine learning analysis and graph-based analysis, and correlative behavioral discovery and predictive recommendations and alerts. 

Common Data Schema

All incoming and outgoing NETCCN data sets will have standardized fields added during preprocessing that allow disparate data sources to be treated similarly - particularly by models and visualizations. All fields, including common schema fields, will include metadata tags that apply to that field across the entire dataset. Examples of common fields include geospatial fields such as FIPS and zip code, temporal fields such as datetime start and end, and disaster metrics annotations such as prediction as a binary classification, quantitative delta, quantitative absolute, qualitative binary, qualitative ordered, and qualitative unordered. These annotations and common schema fields will enable generic disaster-agnostic visualizations to be applied to fields. By leveraging this, the time between the identification of a disaster and the provision of analytics for that disaster will be reduced to that needed to simply require collection and processing of data, and the creation of predictive models. Present and future users will be able to select the data they want to display on the frontend from available data sources, with visualizations making use of common schema fields and annotations to display relevant analytics. A minimum viable data set for patient data exchange is also a priority for our ecosystem in which a potential subset will consist of pulse ox, runny nose, cough, sore throat, escalating symptoms, temperature, age, ethnicity, region, gender, risk scores, medications, pre-existing conditions, and comorbidities.  

Hotspot Forecasting

We will extract data from a myriad of disparate data sources to train and build ensemble ML models to more accurately and precisely forecast COVID19 outbreaks. Potential data aggregators we have catalogued and intend to ingress include NIH COVID Open Access Resources, CDC Cases Data and Surveillance, AWS COVID19 Data Lake, Google Public BigQuery Dataset Program, CORD-19, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We will fuse additional data from DHHS per facility COVID19 Impact, Google COVID-19 Open Data BigQuery, GHX Medical Supply Chain Data, COVID Tracking Project, CDC Social Vulnerability Index, Unacast Social Distancing Scoreboard, and AHA Data COVID-19 Bed Occupancy Projection Tool. 
 
Machine Learning Pipelines

Expression Networks will create a nexus for machine learning and an artificial intelligence hub for NETCCN team collaboration and the broader research community. One of the most exciting technologies we will include in our ecosystem for ML model building and validation is an automated machine learning optimization engine (MILO) that has been developed and validated in over 15+ clinical studies across the United States. MILO will be utilized to rapidly build and validate optimal binary classification algorithms, parametric and nonparametric, by automatically generating and comparing hundreds of thousands of models using industry standard ML algorithms and neural networks. MILO binary classification models can be nested to support as many hierarchical output categories as needed. Use of MILO can save hundreds of hours of PhD-level scientist time, and shorten calendar time delivery cycles from multiple months to a small number of days or less.  Concurrently, Expression will deploy a lifecycle AI/ML pipeline with Azure Databricks, Delta Lake, and Azure HDInsight. Initial exploratory data analysis on Databricks using SciKit Learn and Jupyter Notebooks will inform model building. 

We will use MILO in a range of conditions, including to compute the best performing models for any given binary classification problem on numerical data, validate our data science team’s models, support trust-building in use of AI/ML and explainability with confirmatory results of the main pipeline models, and provide additional models for our data science team to further improve on and augment with human ingenuity. MILO will give Expression Networks and the broader NETCCN ecosystem a valuable advantage for rapidly testing and iterating on classification tasks for clinical decision support and critical event alerting. Models will be trained against and 5-fold cross-validated against historical disaster data. In the case of COVID-19, historic data regarding cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and ICU bed occupancy will be used as validation and testing metrics.

A graph-science machine learning pipeline will prove to be valuable for determining gaps and potential structures and pathways within a complex multi-level NETCCN structure. Network ML models will be linked with patient de-identified data and clinical best practice guidelines in simulations to converge on optimal operating structures. We hypothesize that important meta-nodes such as location, skills, history, personality, and education can be parsed and inferred from our licensing process and will be crucial for optimization and allocation. Furthermore, we will test and iterate on developing ontological network models that are operational and computable through Neural Structured Learning and Neural Graph Learning approaches to ML. 

The AI/ML pipeline will support development of unsupervised deep learning models with graph and unstructured data that will enhance node linkages and validity to improve analysis, decision confidence, and data quality. Expression will apply semi-supervised and supervised deep learning neural network models to NETCCN data. This bi-furcated multi-modal ensemble approach will enable our team to refine model inputs and outputs and discover optimal models and provide users suggested, accurate, and eventually automated solution-set generation, which will reduce cost while supporting the achievement of desired patient outcomes. A future goal here is integration of our AI/ML pipeline and visualization dashboards to provide users the ability to elucidate their needs and goals and select the data elements and groupings for their analysis or program to continually test and improve on model parameters and results.

A Trust Model  for AI/ML Decision-Making (Explainability, Interpretability, Accountability)

It is going to be increasingly important to figure out what are the regions of uncertainty between safe and unsafe states (adapting what is currently used to model safety critical systems in autonomous vehicles). For a predictive system that will inform or make life-or-death decisions, explainability is an essential part of the life cycle. At Expression Networks, we understand the need to assess a model’s decisions and present the reasoning behind those decisions for humans to understand and trust. Ethical explainability leads to accountability, which can open the door to trust in a model and its decisions. It is necessary but not sufficient to validate the model against primary, secondary, and tertiary datasets and verify above a certain level of accuracy and precision. Given the clinical imperative is focused on the patient’s outcome, every decision is important and must mitigate the risk of preventable harm. 

We will leverage existing model explanation visualizations and analyses. Specific implementations meant for use with specific models include Tensorboard for Tensorflow models, captum for PyTorch models, LIME for tree-based models and InterpretML and other techniques available that apply generally to all predictive models. Each model leveraged by Expression Networks will have an associated suite of live explainability analyses, allowing users to follow the decisions the models are making, what parts of the data the model looked at to make those decisions, and in great detail, what parts of that model made those decisions and the reasoning or logic behind those decisions. Building upon these explainability analyses, simulations will be run sampling the input spaces for each of these models as part of the model development lifecycle. By taking a representative sample of all possible input combinations, model “blind spots'' can be determined - regions within the space of input data where the model either does not have sufficient training data to make decisions a human would consider rational, or where the model has overfitted or under fitted data. 

By sampling the input space ahead of time, we will be able to determine irregularities in the model’s logic with the assistance of subject matter experts and clinicians, and adjust model behavior by adding post processing or retraining with engineered features or augmented datasets. These simulations can be rerun as input data changes, and similar explainability analyses can be applied to live feedback data, allowing our data science team to monitor data drift in deployed models and retrain and redeploy when necessary to ensure model outputs remain within safety thresholds. This pairing of systems will provide a managed safety net and a layer of human understanding that enables explainability, trust and accountability in models that can be perceived as black-boxes. 

AI-based clinical decision support will need to establish trust with clinicians in the recommendations provided by the system based on multiple inputs, pipeline process for medical AI/autonomy and the resultant downstream visualizations, alerts, and clinical recommendations based on algorithms and orthogonal models. We will need to build trust and confidence between groups of people but also in our increasing use of AI/ML with clinicians.

We provide an out of the box solution to R&D informatics needs that spans data ingestion, literature workflows, data analytics, team communication and partner collaboration. Our proprietary bioNLP algorithms enable your organization to readily search, find, mine and use almost any text-based document needed in a literature-based workflow. By implementing a serverless and event-driven architecture we provide customers with an ondemand data ingestion process that scales to your data loads. Whether unstructured text or structured research data, scientists can easily get their data into the Catalytic Platform through drag and drop processes or by launching file pickers for larger data ingestion tasks. We use containers to deploy open access, proprietary or third party analytic applications into a highly parallel serverless custom orchestration. This allows our customers to process massive amounts of data in hours or days rather than the weeks or months required by industry standards. stand alone analytics on the Catalytic Platform, pipelines are connected to various Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems or other data storage solutions for easy data import and controlled report output that is secure and can be shared with team members. The Catalytic Platform launches with a set of collaboration services that enable team members to securely communicate in real time while on the platform or their mobile devices. Researchers can share documents, workflows, search results or data analysis reports seamlessly and securely. We comply with NIST, FISMA, and HIPAA guidelines. Our smart engineering decisions have created a scalable cloud-based microservices architecture that orchestrates container images and serverless services. We use this design to integrate internal and external technologies, so we can always interchange solutions and add features quickly. This means our customers get the tools and resources they want and are not locked into a ‘one size fits all’ solution.

1. ITC developed the “Hivemind” application for the Machine-Assisted Analytic Rapid-Repository System (MARS), specifically to expand DIA’s data ingestion and exploitation capabilities. The Hivemind application’s intent is to reduce the time for analysts to perform analytics. It provides more relevant and accurate data from a multitude of data sources, while maintaining referenceable data provenance. This is accomplished not only for new records entered into MARS but to also allows for triggers to automatically source new information and discover new data sources across the various classified and unclassified networks utilizing AI/ML.

2.  For the USAF Kessel Run,  ITC’s fully integrated team of Data Engineers, Data Scientists, Reinforcement Learning Engineers, and Operations Research Analysts supports Kessel Run across its Air and Wing Operations with our Data Engineering and Data Science services. We embrace Agile principles, DevSecOps, and lean product management practices to continuously develop prototype intelligent automations from initial use case, through requirement development, process re-engineering, software implementation and deployment, in a cloud-hosted data platform. We embrace Kessel Run’s culture of rapid feedback loops and user-centered design to rapidly develop, produce, and deploy maintenance models/prototypes while continuously iterating and improving upon those solutions. Models include those built for Air Maintenance Units (AMUs), mission results for predictive data modeling, automated extraction for aircraft maintenance, etc. ",,,,,,,,,

Our chatbot was developed using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning capabilities, so it will understand the user’s intent, the context of their questions, and provide clear answers and support for all their questions in a conversational manner. In addition to the front-end chatbot interface, Auxilium includes an internal analytics and reporting dashboard that displays analytics on chatbot usage, the chatbot’s performance, and generates insights on questions asked. This dashboard provides operational oversight into the chatbot, its performance, and how users are interacting with the chatbot, including correct and missed questions and the top 10 questions users ask.

Compono is a machine learning business process improvement tool that helps users to extract and validate form data. Compono leverages computer vision algorithms to extract unstructured data and validates data across thousands of forms in minutes. Compono turns unstructured forms (PDFs, JPEGs) to structured data and can identify form values even when forms change. This tool can reduce document processing and validation time, establish clear audit trials, and lower barriers to perform analytics and generate insights.

AI models can be biased as models learn to make decisions based on training data, which can include biased human decisions or reflect historical or social inequities. This bias can exist even if sensitive variables such as gender, race, or age are removed because the bias can be manifested through inference. In order to minimize such bias, data scientists need to remove human prejudice in the training data they used during the training lessons. Moreover, data scientists can be especially deliberate about how to define and measure fairness.  The approach we take in reducing bias is requiring models to have equal predictive value across groups and requiring the models to have equal false positive and false negative rates across groups. For Auxilium, we minimize the bias for the AI chatbot by measuring the response rates across groups of users and ensuring the response rates are consistent across all groups of users.",,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2.	Vested® Agreement:  In December we entered in a Vested agreement with JLL.  Vested® is a business model, methodology, mindset and movement for creating highly collaborative business relationships that enable true win-win relationships in which both parties are equally committed to each other’s success.  When applied, a Vested approach fosters an environment that sparks innovation, resulting in improved service, reduced costs and value that didn’t exist before — for both parties.  For more information on Vested, please visit this site. https://www.vestedway.com/what-is-vested/ 
3.	Del Technologies Strategic Alliance Agreement:  Strategic Alliance Agreement is a Dell Technologies program that provides discounts beyond those in Leidos’ current purchasing agreements based on Leidos meeting estimated spend goals on an annual basis; and establishing a TLA commitment.  It provides for Leidos’ participation in the Business Reinvestment Fund. Please see the attached Dell Technologies SAA PowerPoint file for more information.

The main philosophy behind the tool is speed to production. What this means is that it should take significantly less time to build, evaluate, deploy and continually improve machine learning algorithms. It is very expensive to train resources how to properly build and maintain machine learning models since so many moving parts are involved.

The first step in any machine learning model development process always involves retrieving data from identified sources. In many cases, all the data needed to solve a particular problem lives in many different places and is generated by many different systems. One of the goals of MLCircuit was to reduce the time it takes to retrieve data from many disparate, non-standardized sources and store this data in an integrated and useful form.

Internally, we found ourselves constantly re-using the same set of code to pull from various data sources, but never had any mechanism to maintain configurations so that downstream tasks that relied on this data would have reproducible results. To combat this issue, MLCircuit comes with connectors that allow us, for example, to upload a CSV file, write custom query statements that can be executed against a SQL Server and a generalized API call that allows us to retrieve records directly from systems using APIs. MLCircuit exposes these connectors through a web interface that is accessible to our team.

The function of data standardization and storage is critically important. Without standardized and efficient ways to access data, it is impossible to do any machine learning. As part of the data integration process, MLCircuit automatically ensures proper data format, infers datatypes, and stores data in a manner that scales well as the amount of data increases.

In recent tests, we found out that MLCircuit was able to stream over 1 gigabyte of data to its model training engine in less than 20 seconds with low processor overhead. We can do this because under the hood MLCircuit uses a data table specification that frees the data from being tied to any specific programming language and therefore the platform both streams and stores large amounts of data rapidly and efficiently. Furthermore, our experts are able to leverage this component of MLCircuit even if the platform cannot fulfill all the immediate model development requirements. Having this kind of augmented data standardizing capability makes MLCircuit incredibly valuable as it assures that our developers do not have to create a new and unique data storage and standardization plan for every task they are trying to solve, as has universally been the case.

Often, a machine learning developer will run hundreds of iterations on a model before they are satisfied that they squeezed all the performance possible out of it. This is incredibly time consuming and often will require various implementations of data processing algorithms and models. When a developer tries to implement a completely different model, they may have to start from scratch with their data cleansing steps. MLCircuit makes it incredibly easy to try various combinations of models and will save all hyperparameters and evaluation metrics of these models so that results can be compared, and the best model will not be missed or forgotten about. We literally reduce months to days and years to weeks.
To do this, MLCircuit provides our team a drag and drop interface with a sophisticated library of different modules can be dropped and linked together on a canvas that resembles a circuit board (hence “MLCircuit”). The circuit itself is disguised as a computational, noded data flow transformation graph. This framework enables us to constantly add more advanced modules as we encounter more common business use cases. The framework allows our team to test specific nodes without performing a full training run which saves massive amounts of time especially for circuits that use an ensemble of models to accomplish a task.

Our specification facilitates plans to scatter the computation graph across multiple nodes in our cloud environment to enable the platform to scale to true big data workloads. Additionally, “ML Templates” within the platform allow our team to deploy common models and machine learning tasks with just a few clicks. An example of one of these templates is called an Auto Classifier. This classifier will automatically preprocess and search over various classifiers and hyperparameters to find the best model for the data in any given situation. To our experienced ML developers, this is so easy that it almost feels wrong.
Even if a model is trained and is performing well, it needs to be deployed to really start providing any value. This can take a significant amount of time especially when the model has many components that each need to be saved and deployed in a robustly integrated manner. Some of the key parts that are often overlooked when it comes to model deployment are schema validation, security, scalability, and versioning. MLCircuit handles all these parts automatically with one click to deploy the model we are most satisfied with. Rather than investing an entire operations team into deploying and maintaining models in production, MLCircuit tracks the deployed versions of every circuit and allows our team to quickly upgrade the models whenever we choose.","Machine Learning,Predictive Analytics,Prescriptive Analytics,Data Aggregation/Assimilation/Visualization,AI Platform/Framework Tool",,"Corporate Users,Data Scientists,Academics Users,Government Users",,Other,,< 10,Hybrid,Yes,,No,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,Not at this time.,Not at this time.,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

InfoSquirrel™ is a systems-of-systems architecture that includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) that is a force multiplier enabling organizations to store large amounts of historical data with minimal cost and effort. 

The access to and proper application of stored knowledge remains a key challenge of organizations that operate in virtual environments. This challenge continues to increase as the amount of data used and stored by organizations multiplies. The inability to correctly maintain and efficiently apply acquired knowledge can result in reduced effectiveness, re-work, duplication of work, failure to discern and institutionalize best practices, repeated failures, and ultimately becomes a limiting factor in scaling.

InfoSquirrel™ enables teams to quickly access and apply stored organizational information efficiently. InfoSquirrel™ uses advanced methods of metadata tagging, customizable categorization methods, and other industry-specific classification techniques to provide “access lanes” to information. The use of InfoSquirrel™ ultimately drives continual improvement of processes, systems, services, technical ability, and overall capacity in applying knowledge and experience in a codified content management ecosystem.

InfoSquirrel™ can be used in a variety of ways, but specifically is intended for the following general applications:
- Technical proposals and research grants: The InfoSquirrel™ proposal generator rapidly creates technical proposals and research grant proposals using advanced search functions from repositories of documents and automates the document building process. 
 
- Technical standards and specifications: InfoSquirrel™ enables storage and advance searching of technical standards and specifications. The software is designed to enable users to quickly build new specifications, protocols, test methods, procedures, etc. based on stored content in a way that is difficult to achieve with standard file storage and word processing tools. 

- Development of new products and services: Innovation often results from the application of existing capabilities in new combinations and/or through re-framing capabilities for novel uses. InfoSquirrel™ enables quick access to previously solved problems to create new solutions. 

- Refinement of processes and management systems: InfoSquirrel™ enables continual improvement and provides users with tools to quickly access existing information to build modified and improved content.

- Team building: InfoSquirrel™ stores capability information for suppliers and teaming partners for quickly building teams to solve new problems. Teams use InfoSquirrel™ to create solutions while utilizing a secure cloud environment for building and accessing their own library of stored knowledge. InfoSquirrel™ enables organizations and users to identify and engage the right partner for the right purpose. Built content from InfoSquirrel™ can be exported into commonly used tools (i.e., MS Word and SharePoint) for internal and external collaboration.

The Sorcero Language Intelligence Platform offers the ability to develop, manage, and deploy AI-driven applications using scientific content. Sorcero is building the first Natural Language Understanding (NLU) platform designed to deliver an understanding of the scientific content as it is used within a particular industry, enterprise, or workflow.
The goal of the Sorcero Language Intelligence Platform is not to simplify complicated information, but to provide a framework to support the inherent complexity in the content of life and health insurance or life sciences companies. Processing updates that inform physicians of important changes to medical guidelines that determine outcomes for patients, for example, is about finding appropriate solutions, not simplifying existing ones.
Delivering Language Intelligence Applications for a Shifting Information Landscape
Decisions often require an understanding of frequently updated content. Evaluating the importance of changes to that content are important to decision making.
The Sorcero Language Intelligence Platform rapidly enriches that updated content and allows these updates to drive the flow of content into applications. This enrichment is a self-improving entity, powered by that flow of the content.
This entity is only one example of Language Intelligence.
Matching the Complexity of Medical and Scientific Content with Next-Level Technology
Domain by domain, enterprise by enterprise, user by user, Language Intelligence makes sense of scientific content. Language Intelligence provides pipelines for the ingestion of content into AI native formats.
The Sorcero Language Intelligence Platform provides APIs, microservices, and a low-code/no-code development environment that acts as a scaffolding for building AI applications never before possible. 
There are 3 components to the Sorcero Language Intelligence Platform:
1. Ingestion Pipelines
Where unstructured content is ingested - transformed into a format that allows AI applications to better process it.
2. Knowledge Fabric
Where the metadata of content is enriched with sentence vectors, embeddings, etc., and ontologies and lexicons may be automatically generated as part of this enrichment process.
3. Cognitive Tower
Where content flows to improve ontologies, lexicons, sentence vectors, word embeddings, etc., before returning those ontologies, lexicons, sentence vectors, word embeddings, etc. to an updated Knowledge Fabric for better enrichment of content going forward.
Utility Sets
The platform is accessed through Utility Sets, which are groups of pipelines applied to content 
that has been enriched in the Knowledge Fabric to create artifacts such as summaries, query expansions, etc.
Low-Code Development
Artifacts created by utility sets, along with the content that has been through the knowledge fabric, are all used to develop, manage, and deploy applications in a low-code environment.","Natural Language Processing,Data Aggregation/Assimilation/Visualization,AI Platform/Framework Tool",,"Corporate Users,Value Added Resellers,Government Users",,"""Freemium"": Limited version available as free or open source, full version and product support is commercial,Subscription license,Cost based upon seats",,< 10,Commercial/proprietary,Yes,,Yes,"Free online training/webinars,Self-paced online training",,Low (1 - 5 days),Low (1 - 5 days),No,No,,"Software Engineer,Systems Administrator,Business Process Owner","Systems Engineer,Systems Administrator,Business Process Owner",Recorded tutorials,,,,General Services Administration,"Yes, but it does not have a public link yet.","Yes, but it does not have a public link yet.",Yes,"For individual services, our output is annotated.

Our documentation artifacts are developed in four phases or functional components: assumptions, data aggregation, mission relevant activity summarization, and the machine learning/algorithms. We document the assumptions under which the technologies or processes which comprise the model or prototype was developed. Typical assumptions cover the validity and availability of the data supporting the model or prototype. The relationship of the model or prototype to the physical system or situation which is represented within the model. Many times, these relationships include the policies, procedures, or environments within which the model is valid. Finally, we include the time periods or external situations under which the model is valid versus those situations which could lead to invalid results.  In documenting data aggregation, we focus on the mechanisms used to collect the data from the supporting authoritative sources with data dictionaries and definitions for each element. We document the processing steps used in the extract, transform and load (ETL) components which includes any validation and verification. Data documentation will also explain the relationship between data elements whether these represent dependencies or supporting components which add to a level of confidence in a decision. The data aggregation overall is approximately 20% of the project difficulty.  The next phase is documenting the summarization of the data into mission relevant components, factors, facts, trends, rates, bounds or other information to enable the machine learning or algorithm to perform its mission. The artifacts developed map the data to the mission relevant components along with the supporting analytic reasons behind this mapping. Typically, this phase can consume 70% of the difficulty and effort.  When documenting the model or prototype algorithm, we include all the processes, whether based on simple business rules, binary logic, mathematical relationships or solving systems of equations in real time. The key component of AI or ML prototypes is the ability of the processing or algorithm to improve future responses (in terms of whatever metric is important to the business) which each run or execution. The feedback of success or failure with each run supports the model improvement. This feedback loop and how the adjustments in parameter weighting, rule adjustments, and process realignment is described in our documentation. This component of the documentation links back to the mission relevant component mapping of the previous step. After multiple generations of model improvement, the exact weighting or rule sequence may not be as originally developed, the process of the improvement is described as is the mechanism by which the model or process improved incrementally.",F_xgAh4uidJ9qnR0l,Halvik Principles for Ethical and Explainable AI.pdf,282678,application/pdf,,F_AdMkIi2bun7yHKx,Halvik AI Solution for VDAS OST.pdf,275249,application/pdf,,,,,,,,,,

Overview

Cloud applications let you go beyond process execution and use your data to explore fields such as artificial intelligence (predictive analysis), integrate reporting tools of your choice, and create portals to provide a richer user experience.

Artificial Intelligence is an application which lets you explore machine learning capabilities directly in your Bizagi processes, by letting the processes use a predictive analysis service that is based upon the reliable data that you have in a Bizagi Dataset (Business Insights).

Through predictive analysis, you can train models and carry out experiments that rely on renowned machine learning algorithms to determine a given outcome based on stored data with a given degree of certainty.

For such models, you can easily set your Bizagi processes to present a prediction once certain data has been provided. You can use that prediction as a default value, or offer it for user approval.

Cloud_AI_overview

You can configure all of this without being an expert data scientist.

Bizagi Artificial Intelligence lets you predict categorical or numerical attributes and variables using Artificial Intelligence algorithms so you can use the results in your Bizagi processes or as a basis for making decisions. Some examples of use case statements could be:

•For a credit application process where a customer requests a loan:

Based on credit amount, customer type and credit type, we could predict whether the process requires additional documentation (predicting a categorical variable).

•For a vehicle insurance underwriting process:

Based on insurance amount, customer type and estimated price, we could predict an estimated duration for which to approve the insurance underwriting (predicting a numerical variable).

•For a help desk support process where a customer submits a ticket:

Based on severity, operating system, and ticket type, we could predict whether the ticket is likely to be resolved by first-level support, or whether it will need to be escalated to second or to third-level support (predicting a categorical variable).

Cloud_AI_usage

Before you start

Artificial Intelligence relies on Bizagi Business Insights as its data provider.

Before moving on, make sure you are familiar with Bizagi Business Insights, and have created a Dataset to use with the Artificial Intelligence application.

Getting started with Bizagi Artificial Intelligence

When you purchase Bizagi Artificial Intelligence, you need to provide the users who are authorized to log in its secondary portal created. Send the list of users via Ticket. Once you receive the answer to the ticket. Your authorized users need to use the Forgot password option to set their passwords.

The following steps summarize at high level how you work with Artificial Intelligence:

1. Create an AI model and define its data source.

Set it to connect to a Dataset, that holds relevant data.

2. Explore the results of different experiments, and choose a configuration that provides results that satisfy your use case statement.

You can evaluate possible combinations of input parameters and algorithms.

Once the experiment is satisfactory and final, publish it.

3. Connect your Bizagi processes to consume the predictive analysis service so that each new case can make use of a preliminary prediction for an attribute/value.

Configure the invocation to use a RESTful service and that's it.

Important recommendations

1. Always create models and experiments based on real data (e.g, by using a Dataset from the Production environment).

2. Only publish an experiment when it is satisfactory.

Publishing an experiment allows you to use one service endpoint for testing, and another one for real use (a process's Production environment).

For the service endpoint used in testing, you may define fixed rules so that your AI service returns predictable outputs and you can easily work in all of the process’s different paths.

3. Constantly train the model.

By default, new data stored in the Dataset is not considered by an experiment until you explicitly train the model to re-evaluate the data.

When you do this, make sure to re-publish the experiment so that the same service endpoint being used by processes is updated.

You can update an existing experiment which has been published and is under current use.

4. When an experiment in current use changes its input or output definitions, you need to create a new experiment.

We strongly recommend this as a best practice to maintain the stability of ongoing processes.

HumanTouch has formed Bering - HumanTouch, JV1, LLC (BHT), a Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Alaskan Native-Owned Corporation (ANC) Joint Venture (JV) between Bering Global Solutions, LLC (BGS) and HumanTouch, LLC (HT). As an All-Small Mentor Protégé program JV, BHT offers federal clients direct access to experienced IT professional services with the benefit of reduced programmatic risk typically inherent in competitive procurements. BGS is a subsidiary of Bering Straits Native Corporation (BSNC), an ANC, and certified as an SBA 8(a) participant in 2018. The combination of the SBA 8(a) certification and ANC status means Federal clients can contract, without competition or dollar limit to BHT (see 13 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 124.506(b)). A direct award to BHT is not subject to protest (see 3 CFR 124.517(a)) and the Federal Agency can claim Small Disadvantaged and Native American credit (see 13 CFR 124.109 and 124.105). As the Mentor, HT is an established “other than small” privately owned business.  The HT Top-Secret (TS) facility clearance supports the JV under recent (11/2020) SBA rule changes.  ",,,,,,,,,

Our platform supports a variety of customizable perspectives, lighting and weather conditions, heights, and point-of-views, the ability to import classified objects as well as multiple camera sensors including outside the visible spectrum. This flexibility helps generate enormous amounts of diversity, which is important to bridge the “domain gap” between synthetic and real world data.

By generating synthetic data at scale (in the millions), AI.Reverie’s platform can reduce the cost of traditional methods by up to 60x and save significant time (days not months) to label real world images and videos. This will result in significant improvement in algorithm performance at much lower costs empowering analysts with the ability to identify or track objects and detect behavior from imagery and increase the output of each analyst and save lives.

We have made it our mission to transform the way our Government interacts with and uses data and technology, and we bring a unique approach to this mission. 
We have a large portfolio of work providing expert services in advanced analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), and data visualizations across Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR), Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I)), the Department of Defense’s Joint AI Center (JAIC), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). In addition, we have supported telecommunications data analysis efforts for DHS Headquarters and the following components: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), USCIS, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Secret Service (USSS) and DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG).
Redhorse’s cross-functional data analytics teams include data engineers, data scientists, cross-trained analysts, design thinking experts, software engineers and user interface designers. Our preferred staffing mix combines operations research systems analysts and data scientists with domain subject matter experts, hand-selected and cross-trained using our proprietary analyst curriculum. They are supported by IT architects, data engineers and application developers to help organizations identify critical issues and solve important problems using their valuable data. Our technical approach is to empower cross-functional teams with proven processes, methodologies, technologies, and tools. Our goal is to provide data-driven capabilities that make the agency more efficient and effective, so we team world-class data science talent with mission or subject-matter expertise, operations research methodologies, and constant engagement with the decision makers we serve to create solutions that improve outcomes. How we tailor the skills mix is specific to any project, but SummIT Alliance has proven that an artful combination of professional viewpoints and skillsets can make our team more effective in enabling data-driven decision-making. 
We have established an internally funded horizontal organization at Redhorse to invest in our AI/ML capability. This horizontal represents Redhorse’s investment in data science expertise and creates a centralized place to manage and hone data science skills across the company, as well as engage and implement continuous learning / training opportunities in both new technologies and service concepts. This group enables strategic alignment and prioritization for AI and ML work, effective matrix-based resource management, capacity planning & coordination across teams. The horizontal also serves as a center of excellence for solution development and guidance, and creation of test cases and prototypes. 
To keep our team current and refreshed, we have a robust internship program that pulls undergraduate and graduate data science talent from top tier universities for summer programs. Interns work in an agile environment to produce a capstone pilot using emerging technologies for government-focused use cases. This builds a unique pipeline of data science professionals trained in cutting edge, emerging technologies and skilled at applying solutions to Federal Government use cases. We generally hire one to three of the most innovative interns for permanent employment and maintain contact with the remaining class in the event their skill sets are needed at a later date. Interns become a unique pipeline of candidates as they are not only well educated in data science from an academic standpoint, but also familiar with our corporate processes and government contracting.
We do not create solutions in a vacuum, in addition to our internal cross-matrixing across organizational groups and the aforementioned horizontal, we partner with large-scale industry vendors like Azure and AWS as well as more specific technology vendors like GraphAware and Veritone.  We also continue to develop and maintain relationships with firms in Silicon Valley to enable our team to leverage the newest technologies and tools.",,,,,,,,,

Glyphic employs that but also allows rule-based queries to use the structure and formatting of the document to identify possible content of interest.  The library provides an expressive language for implementing content queries for PDF extraction, the data structures for efficient processing of those queries, and interfaces for accessing those queries from a larger system. Glyphic integrates smoothly with best-in-class OCR for digitization of scanned documents and can be deployed on prem and on cloud, depending on customer requirements.

Advantages over coordinate and text-based solutions:
-Maintains hierarchical relationships among structural components
-Robustly handles routine shifts and movements in content; not bound to exact positioning
-Query language unifies both coordinate and text-based approaches

We designed a business process to integrate the microservice into the existing HHS operating model, and implemented human-centered design techniques to build a customized, interactive user interface (UI).
The Nolij-lead HHS BuySmarter team used open-source natural language processing (NLP) techniques to construct a machine learning (ML) data workflow pipeline. The pipeline extracts semi-structured procurement-related data from HHS contract files. Working with data from the prior three years of procurement contracts—consisting of over 1.3 million contract attachments from all 26 HHS operational divisions—Nolij selected, trained, optimized, and tested the machine learning models. Nolij selected and defined the attributes captured by the AI pipeline in collaboration with HHS subject matter experts (SMEs), taking weekly feedback into account throughout the development process.
The AI pipeline takes any document or segment of text and extracts procurement-related information, such as what was purchased, the unit price of the purchase, the delivery methods, and the warranty information, along with many more attributes. The goal of extracting this information is to find the lowest prices for the purchase of like items across operational divisions, to demand lower pricing among all divisions.

HHS Accelerate is a modern contract writing system populated by information from various sophisticated microservices and databases. The Nolij team developed the BuySmarter AI microservice to function properly within the Accelerate environment and integrate fully with the data systems and security of the Accelerate architecture and infrastructure.
The early stages of the project presented additional complexities. To train the machine learning (ML) models in the microservice, complexity arose in the need to duplicate contract data from HHS Accelerate in the team’s AWS servers. This challenge posed both security and feasibility concerns. The team overcame this challenge by extracting raw text metadata from all file types during the transfer, rather than transferring the original contract files themselves; this meant the text metadata could be transferred in less time (as text files are typically one-tenth the size of highly formatted files such as Word, PDF, or Excel files). Additionally, text metadata are more secure in transfer because they do not compromise the format of the original files.

•	
•	PROF Uses new Bayes Learning probabilistic and causal reasoning models that only require small data samples to infer and reason outcomes solving the AI cold start problem;
•	The PROF Cloud-based Framework sits outside any LMS and interfaces via API. 

Integrated Domain Knowledge (IDK):  employs a revised NLP auto-regression transformer XL network model, designed to process massive NLP datasets that contain the course content.

Highly Adaptive Content Knowledge Distributor (HACKD): generates a syllabus for any course given the course title, subject, learning outcomes, grading scheme, and duration – and will adjust assignment deadlines based on learner performance.

Classroom Management Intelligence (CMI):  determines if a cluster, sub-cluster, or individual learner is causing disruption, negatively influencing, or distracting the learning process, and determine an appropriate disciplinary response. 

Dynamic Adaptable Teaching Methodology (DATM):  parses and classifies defined MBTI personality traits, learning styles, grouping status, and extra-curricular issues that may impact learning and adapts teaching methodologies to match learner styles, abilities, personality traits, and general aptitude.

Expression Module:  allows PROF to express different emotions during instruction sessions based on learner traits, responses, and performance.

Valkyrie provides a framework for integration with distributed processing and allows for scaling, monitoring, and distribution of workloads to ML services and other canned services, the first being Linear Optimization. Valkyrie currently provides web service APIs, allowing applications to submit data (PULP Models) to deployed Linear Optimization services. Applications call these services to efficiently solve complex data problems, and without having to procure additional licenses or deploy additional infrastructure. OneGlobe engineers and data scientists are leading the active program increment of Valkyrie, which is expanding upon this architecture to provide a full ML lifecycle platform for deploying, scaling, exposing, and transporting data to production ready ML models and other canned AI services. It is built on a Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) platform that provides services to train, version control, deploy, and monitor ML models as API endpoints. 

Echidna delivers turnkey self-service environments to enable data scientists throughout Kessel Run to efficiently import Air Force data and perform analysis by leveraging a scalable compute infrastructure. The initial program increment delivers a JupiterHub platform that gives end-users Jupyter Notebooks environments that run on Kubernetes infrastructure. In subsequent PIs, OneGlobe personnel will provide; ingest points for data coming off various Kessel Run data services, interfaces to Valkyrie to deploy models using the ML Ops pipeline, and a repository for models and other data science artifacts to enable seamless collaboration within Kessel Run.

Booz Allen has taken a number of approaches to ensure our AI solutions can be explained to both technical practitioners as well as a third-party auditor. Each of these approaches creates a usable mapping from the model output back to the input variables that had the greatest influence in the prediction. This mapping can then be converted into any format that best suits the needs of the work (e.g., formatting for human analysis may require digital dashboard or generation of a printable document; whereas, formatting for use in a downstream automated system may require additional considerations). We, at Booz Allen, believe stakeholders want to know what a prediction means and what to do about it. To this end, instead of simply providing AI model recommendations, our products and services strive to provide clear-language descriptions of the characteristics of that AI model’s recommendation and the extent to which input variables have contributed to that recommendation.  One approach is Booz Allen’s partnership with industry partners that specialize in explaining AI outputs for specific industries or use-cases. Booz Allen also utilizes best-in-breed explainability COTS and open-source software offerings. Booz Allen also has the in-house expertise to develop custom explainability capabilities as needed by the client.

With an eye towards a wide range of applications, RTRC has maintained focus on developing intelligence for systems in a manner that is versatile and portable – largely platform agnostic, able to interface with a variety of sensors, and generally modular, with the ability to be modified and configured for different use cases. Research at RTRC spans many areas critical for the development of autonomous systems, including planning, perception, augmented and virtual reality, and human-robot collaboration. RTRC’s autonomy research also has an emphasis on developing capabilities to enable systems to function autonomously in uncertain environments – adapting to changes in its surroundings, responding to unpredictable interactions with a human partner, or determining a contingency plan. This approach has supported RTRC’s creation of a significant library of robust, versatile capabilities to continue to build upon in the development of autonomous systems, leveraging the varied technical backgrounds of members of RTRC’s autonomy program and maintaining a focus on approaching problems in a manner that ensures that solutions developed can be widely deployed and used across different platforms and applications.

Some of the capabilities developed for these applications include collaborative autonomy and multi-agent teaming, render-based mapping for highly-detailed, accurate maps generated in near real-time, tactile perception, augmented and virtual reality to enhance user interaction with a platform or maps generated by a platform, and machine/robot learning from demonstration. This broad portfolio of capabilities, combined with RTRC’s commitment to development of portable intelligence that can be leveraged across different platforms, sensing modalities, and applications, affords RTRC the unique position of supporting rapid development with an emphasis on versatile intelligence to enable autonomous capabilities.

RTRC’s autonomy lab is outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment supporting development of varied capabilities toward autonomous operation of different platforms for a wide-range of tasks. The lab includes UAVs of varying scales and suited for different applications, and several robotic arms, mobile robots, and mobile manipulator platforms. The lab is equipped with full motion capture coverage through installation of a Vicon system in the two-story lab space, and has a safety-netted volume accommodating small UAV indoor flight. Additionally, there is an outdoor space where testing of ground vehicles and collaborative air-ground vehicle systems has also been performed.

There are also several augmented and virtual reality systems in the lab to support development of AR/VR-enhanced autonomy and HMI/HRI capabilities. Augmented and Virtual Reality solutions have been developed at RTRC for many different applications, including training of human technicians, training of robots through learning from demonstration in a virtual environment, and interaction with maps of spaces being inspected. RTRC has a number of AR/VR configurations that can be used with various platforms and across applications.

Beyond the physical lab space, RTRC has developed a robust simulation environment to support development and testing. This physics-based simulation allows for photorealistic rendering that supports rapid development, testing, and refinement of software, as well as facilitating implementation on hardware.

Perception
RTRC has broad capabilities in perception and computer vision, with well-developed solutions for purposes such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and simulation. These can support a variety of use cases such as visual inspection, autonomous operation of different types of vehicles navigating varied environments, or different robotic manipulators handling objects in cluttered spaces. With a patented method for dense, render-based mapping as a cornerstone of UTRC’s perception capabilities, we are able to produce highly-detailed, extremely accurate maps that provide rich details, supporting resolution of fine features, enhancing localization accuracy, and improving a user’s ability to interpret and interact with a map of an object or scene.

Planning
RTRC has significant experience in the areas of AI-based planning and decision making. A hierarchical, multi-objective planning framework has been developed, and refined across different programs, that supports functionality spanning high-level mission planning, mid-level path planning, and low-level trajectory planning. As a result, RTRC has a substantial library of planning software based on a variety of algorithms, including Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) for strategic planning under uncertainty, Spectral Multi-scale Coverage (SMC) for wide area coverage and search, sampling-based multi-objective path planning for obstacle avoidance, and MPC-based dynamic trajectory generation. With a robust, application-agnostic, platform-agnostic planning framework, RTRC’s capabilities in planning and control can be leveraged in different use cases, interfacing with different perception and mapping infrastructures, ranging from in-house developed RenderMap to open source mapping infrastructures available in ROS. These capabilities have also been demonstrated on a variety of mobile autonomous platforms, including indoor and outdoor ground and aerial vehicles, operating in single agent or multi-agent collaborative scenarios. The planning technology developments have also been applied to trajectory and motion planning for robotic manipulation as well as task allocation and planning for human-robot collaboration.

Human Robot Collaboration
Human Robot Interaction and Human Machine Interaction has been a consistent focus in autonomy research at RTRC. There is increasing emphasis on the ability of systems to anticipate and adapt to human needs and variations in human behaviors when collaborating on a task. Research in this area will allow robots to better support humans in performing tasks, particularly those that result in significant cognitive and/or physical fatigue, which can ultimately lead to errors or injury. Some of the capability development in this area has focused on human intent recognition, learning from demonstration, and task allocation.","Natural Language Processing,Neural Networks,Machine Learning,Predictive Analytics,Prescriptive Analytics,Data Aggregation/Assimilation/Visualization,Robotic Process Automation,Machine Vision",,"Data Scientists,Academics Users,Government Users",,Other,Tailored to user requirements.,10 - 100,Commercial/proprietary,Other,Depends on application and security requirements.,Yes,"In-person, onsite training for a fee,Online training/webinars for a fee,Free online training/webinars",,Medium (2 - 4 weeks),Medium (2 - 4 weeks),No,No,,"Data Engineer,DevOps Engineer,Data Scientists","Software Engineer,Systems Engineer,DevOps Engineer",Other,Tailored to user needs.,ITAR,,,,,Yes,RTRC has expertise in explainable AI,,,,,"RTRC has 50+ patents submitted for its AI capabilities and 32+ publications for conference/journals/workshops.

Please describe the partnership or alliance.,"VC/SAS PARTNERSHIP:  Visual Connections and SAS have had an ongoing formal partnership for four-plus years focused on the federal and commercial healthcare markets.   Our work has included co-developing analytic use cases for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) clients to develop performance-based dashboards, a long-term project to develop a predictive model of Medicare Advantage diagnosis-code based payment error and co-presenting the use of SAS Analytic tools to investigate patterns of opioid abuse in the Appalachian region of the United States. SAS and Visual Connections have maintained weekly meetings over the entire length of the partnership where we review ongoing projects, troubleshoot technical issues, and share technical support. SAS has assisted Visual Connections in developing product demonstrations for CMS clients, mentoring in model development, and providing formal training on cutting edge software releases. Visual Connections has assisted SAS by providing subject matter expertise on CMS data, co-presenting at SAS-based conferences including the SAS Global Forum and SAS User Groups, as well as developing a Medicare Part D training presentation to support SAS in a Capstone partnership with graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University. 

VC/PEGA: Visual Connections has a long-standing history of implementing PEGA solutions and working with PEGA in the federal and commercial healthcare markets. Our more recent PEGA experience involves PEGA RPA solutions.  More specifically, our work in support of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) involved a Proof of Concept (POC) and Go-Live phases for the purpose of developing “process automations” to improve accuracy, efficiency, and reduce costs within the RADV Central Data Abstraction Tool (CDAT) environment for the CMS Affordable Care Act Risk Adjustment Data Validation Contract (ACA RADV).  We developed a process automation (PA tool) that uses Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to review and process medical records and then determine their validity. The PA tool required VC to showcase outcomes that minimized human involvement during the RADV intake processes, allowing records to process more quickly, and enabling CMS to redistribute professional resources to more complex work, thereby most effectively utilizing their competencies.  CMS realized significant cost and resource savings when the AI solution was run end-to-end in comparison to the human process.  VC’s contract experience also includes configuration and integration services for PEGA BPM and CRM solutions.  Case studies are available upon request.

With its Platform, Uptake has built connectors to 270+ OT and IT data sources, 150B data points to serve over 100 customers across eight industries, and has deployed over 1,300 machine learning models across 1.3M machines.
At most industrial companies, available data is often out of date, incomplete, and stored in disparate tools across organizations, creating silos that give an incomplete view of business operations. Historically, applying data science has mainly been restricted to technical users. These users often have access to just a subset of the available data, lacking the context to more significant data environments and subsequent business knowledge. Due to nuances and hierarchical complexities of industrial data, such users often spend as much as 80% of their time preparing and transforming data before a single data science model can be built and deployed.
The Uptake Platform addresses this siloed and inefficient workflow, taking data from assets, work orders, enterprise systems, and curated sources focused on delivering valuable insights. It enables Uptake and its customers to create insights that drive financial outcomes in minutes or hours, rather than days. Using industrial AI and machine learning generates actionable recommendations that grow more effective over time-based on measurable business outcomes
Uptake’s Radar application is an advanced analytics dashboard highlighting the asset and operational metrics that matter most to our users. The insights produced by Uptake’s Platform (both machine learning and customer-defined) are surfaced in the Uptake Radar application, and paired with relevant supporting evidence to provide confidence to technicians and improve the probability of them taking action. The use of Uptake’s Radar application results in the reduction of catastrophic failures, increases in asset performance, conversion of unplanned downtime into planned maintenance, and optimization of operating and maintenance cost
The performance results surfaced in the Model Performance Dashboard and the visualizations of those performance results provide users with an understanding of when a model is performing well or poorly, and what version of a model is performing the worst or best, such that a data scientist can determine whether they should take action on a specific model in order to optimize model performance.

We have developed an NLP product that can greatly reduce the time taken to search through hundreds of documents and only give you results that pertaining to what a user is searching for. The ability to discover knowledge that is embedded in countless documents such as laws, regulatory documents, guidance, other artifacts etc. and map it to agency' orders and policy with traceability and linkages is of great value to user that take days to do the same task e.g., an aviation safety inspector may takes days searching through order, compliance and guidelines in order to complete its investigation whereas our tool will enable the safety inspector to complete this in matter of minutes.

We have made it our mission to transform the way our Government interacts with and uses data and technology, and we bring a unique approach to this mission. 
We have a large portfolio of work providing expert services in advanced analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), and data visualizations across Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR), Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I)), the Department of Defense’s Joint AI Center (JAIC), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). In addition, we have supported telecommunications data analysis efforts for DHS Headquarters and the following components: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), USCIS, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Secret Service (USSS) and DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG).
SummIT Alliance’s cross-functional data analytics teams include data engineers, data scientists, cross-trained analysts, design thinking experts, software engineers and user interface designers. Our preferred staffing mix combines operations research systems analysts and data scientists with domain subject matter experts, hand-selected and cross-trained using our proprietary analyst curriculum. They are supported by IT architects, data engineers and application developers to help organizations identify critical issues and solve important problems using their valuable data. Our technical approach is to empower cross-functional teams with proven processes, methodologies, technologies, and tools. Our goal is to provide data-driven capabilities that make the agency more efficient and effective, so we team world-class data science talent with mission or subject-matter expertise, operations research methodologies, and constant engagement with the decision makers we serve to create solutions that improve outcomes. How we tailor the skills mix is specific to any project, but SummIT Alliance has proven that an artful combination of professional viewpoints and skillsets can make our team more effective in enabling data-driven decision-making. 
We have established an internally funded horizontal organization at Redhorse to invest in our AI/ML capability. This horizontal represents Redhorse’s investment in data science expertise and creates a centralized place to manage and hone data science skills across the company, as well as engage and implement continuous learning / training opportunities in both new technologies and service concepts. This group enables strategic alignment and prioritization for AI and ML work, effective matrix-based resource management, capacity planning & coordination across teams. The horizontal also serves as a center of excellence for solution development and guidance, and creation of test cases and prototypes. 
To keep our team current and refreshed, we have a robust internship program that pulls undergraduate and graduate data science talent from top tier universities for summer programs. Interns work in an agile environment to produce a capstone pilot using emerging technologies for government-focused use cases. This builds a unique pipeline of data science professionals trained in cutting edge, emerging technologies and skilled at applying solutions to Federal Government use cases. We generally hire one to three of the most innovative interns for permanent employment and maintain contact with the remaining class in the event their skill sets are needed at a later date. Interns become a unique pipeline of candidates as they are not only well educated in data science from an academic standpoint, but also familiar with our corporate processes and government contracting.
We do not create solutions in a vacuum, in addition to our internal cross-matrixing across organizational groups and the aforementioned horizontal, we partner with large-scale industry vendors like Azure and AWS as well as more specific technology vendors like GraphAware and Veritone.  We also continue to develop and maintain relationships with firms in Silicon Valley to enable our team to leverage the newest technologies and tools.
We are actively participating in accreditation processes in multiple engagements and have received relevant ATOs from OUSD(I). Our partner products have had ATO approvals at agencies like DoD and DOJ.

For our child welfare predictive risk modeling (PRM) offering, Mathematica has established a partnership focused on the safe and ethical use of predictive analytics for child protection and can assist states and counties with implementing PRM tools. The partnership is a collaboration across several organizations, which brings together leaders and experts in the field of child welfare and data analytics with the experience and capacity to work collaboratively with state and county agencies to implement PRM tools. The following people and their educational institutions are part of this partnership with Mathematica:

• Rhema Vaithianathan, professor of health economics and director of the Centre for Social Data Analytics, Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, and professor of social data analytics, Institute for Social Science Research, The University of Queensland, Australia

All Mathematica employees must become familiar with the Code and complete training and certification annually so that Mathematica can remain compliant with federal requirements. Although we do not have a specific policy around AI ethics, Mathematica staff have written blog posts and other publicly available documents summarizing our approach to AI ethics and providing guidance to other vendors.  See here, for example: https://www.mathematica.org/commentary/ethics-and-artificial-intelligence-in-health-care-the-pivot-point","Mathematica does not have a specific, corporate-wide policy regarding evaluation and mitigation of bias. However, our Code of Ethics and Conduct obligates staff to apply the highest standards of scientific objectivity and integrity in all of our research and data analytic efforts. In contexts where model bias poses a potential concern, Mathematica performs model evaluation and seeks to mitigate any disparate impact on specific subgroups.  For example, Mathematica works with various state child welfare agencies to develop predictive risk modeling (PRM) tools that can identify children at particular risk of maltreatment. Stakeholders often worry that data used for training PRM tools might be racially biased. This concern is valid, given the acknowledged bias in contributing data sets. To mitigate these concerns, Mathematica studies how well a PRM tool performs for different racial subgroups and takes steps to ensure that the tool gauges risk similarly for each subgroup. Because of these steps, PRMs can be a useful tool to identify bias in existing decision making processes by documenting where there is unwarranted variation in the system’s response to families based on race (or other demographic variables), rather than risk.",Yes,"Mathematica places a high premium on the explainability of our models and analytical tools. Our decision-support tools help government agencies navigate an environment where it is hard to separate “noise” from “signal” by (1) using modeling approaches (whether parametric or non-parametric) that provide for the greatest degree of interpretability, and (2) ensuring that the model training process is transparent and well-documented.   Specifically, we make sure that our predictive modeling tools clearly explain what features are being used and their relative importance in the model. We also work to ensure that any tools we develop provide clear and transparent assessments around model accuracy or other relevant metrics (including for subpopulations), as well as the specific use-cases for which the tool was built.",F_elkxBTxBAu2w4al,Mathematica AI and ML Integrator Service Offerings.pdf,992253,application/pdf,,F_2nsZ6kRk8PbPgPv,Mathematica AI and ML Integrator Service Offerings.pdf,992253,application/pdf,,,,,,,,,,

Our solution, focused on data quality, not only supports compliance with the US HHS ACF Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS) requirements, but it ultimately supports all of the ways that child welfare data are used. Investing in high data quality will help state child welfare agencies meet federal and state reporting requirements, conduct advanced analytics with reliable data, and employ data effectively to manage program performance and make decisions.

Mathematica includes three key components in a comprehensive solution to ensure the quality of child welfare data:

· Data quality planning. Mathematica will assess data quality and develop a data quality plan that meets ACF's CCWIS requirements and supports performance management and data-driven decision making for child welfare agencies.

· Continuous data quality monitoring. Mathematica will deliver continuous monitoring of CCWIS data quality to measure progress and guide improvements. The foundation of continuously monitoring data quality is our data quality monitoring product, which is a technical form of data validation that enables us to continuously monitor data quality standards and identify where quality must improve.

· Data quality reporting and support.

All Mathematica employees must become familiar with the Code and complete training and certification annually so that Mathematica can remain compliant with federal requirements. Although we do not have a specific policy around AI ethics, Mathematica staff have written blog posts and other publicly available documents summarizing our approach to AI ethics and providing guidance to other vendors.  See here, for example: https://www.mathematica.org/commentary/ethics-and-artificial-intelligence-in-health-care-the-pivot-point","Mathematica does not have a specific, corporate-wide policy regarding evaluation and mitigation of bias. However, our Code of Ethics and Conduct obligates staff to apply the highest standards of scientific objectivity and integrity in all of our research and data analytic efforts. In contexts where model bias poses a potential concern, Mathematica performs model evaluation and seeks to mitigate any disparate impact on specific subgroups.  For example, Mathematica works with various state child welfare agencies to develop predictive risk modeling (PRM) tools that can identify children at particular risk of maltreatment. Stakeholders often worry that data used for training PRM tools might be racially biased. This concern is valid, given the acknowledged bias in contributing data sets. To mitigate these concerns, Mathematica studies how well a PRM tool performs for different racial subgroups and takes steps to ensure that the tool gauges risk similarly for each subgroup. Because of these steps, PRMs can be a useful tool to identify bias in existing decision making processes by documenting where there is unwarranted variation in the system’s response to families based on race (or other demographic variables), rather than risk.",Yes,"""Mathematica places a high premium on the explainability of our models and analytical tools. Our decision-support tools help government agencies navigate an environment where it is hard to separate “noise” from “signal” by (1) using modeling approaches (whether parametric or non-parametric) that provide for the greatest degree of interpretability, and (2) ensuring that the model training process is transparent and well-documented.   Specifically, we make sure that our predictive modeling tools clearly explain what features are being used and their relative importance in the model. We also work to ensure that any tools we develop provide clear and transparent assessments around model accuracy or other relevant metrics (including for subpopulations), as well as the specific use-cases for which the tool was built.""",,,,,,F_O7GC2bwRtrW8oOR,"Mathematica AI and ML Product, Child Welfare Data Quality Tool.pdf",604061,application/pdf,,,,,,,,,,

As part of our solution design process, we collaborate with customers to define challenges, understand their data, identify solution components, assess readiness, and create plans to achieve the solution.  We iteratively develop a working prototype, collecting and exploring data, deriving insight, visualizing results, and refining models through testing and analysis. We fully integrate the solution into a client environment with custom tools, optimized processes, and focused support to ensure client satisfaction.  

Here are examples of the customized solutions we have implemented.

1.	Air Force National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC). Since 2019, LinQuest has delivered advanced design of experiments and machine learning application to harness the digital modeling and simulation of DoD environments and tools by building on our proprietary solution, Harness for Adaptive Learning (HAL). HAL allows users to iteratively run simulation models to optimize end results. Current applications involve our product being used to wrap hypersonic weapon system models.  We fully explored the design space of these digital models and weapon representations through the application of iteratively built space-filling designs and output automation via machine learning. We delivered front-end scripting in Python to run the model at particular spots to optimize the performance based on past outputs.  This product is model agnostic and has been used to do similar exploration of digital environments with various models/tools to include physics and engineering models, mission-level models, and campaign-level modeling tools.  In 2020, LinQuest developed a point-and-click user interface for customers to connect via API to harness scripting capability. LinQuest has can deliver this software capability for other customers.


2.	Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (LCMC)’s Data Analytics Resource Team (DART).  LinQuest is applying advanced data science methods to the Air Force sustainment community at Life Cycle Management Center (LCMC)’s Data Analytics Resource Team (DART) with specific focus applied to exploration of structured and unstructured data within Air Force contracts.  Our team has built an Air Force-owned solution for ingesting and exploiting the contract data of over three million contracts within the Air Force contract database.  Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other AI/ML techniques, our data science team is able to provide the Air Force contracts and program offices insight on these contracts with information related to pricing, category management, and CLIN structures.  Further work is being done to exploit this unstructured and structured data to allow the Air Force to gain efficiencies in contract actions.  For our LCMC customer, we have also applied discrete event simulation with regression-based models to predict Mission Capabilities (MICAPs) for the B-2 and CV-22 weapon systems and parts, enabling predictions about risks and health of the program health.  We delivered presentations and reports on the studies.


3.	Pinakes. LinQuest was contracted to study the use of Machine Learning (ML) to classify millions of government documents.  Given the large number of documents that exist within the organization automation is the only way to meet this requirement.   We developed a micro-service based application that utilizes Machine Learning (ML) to accurately categorize these records. LinQuest and its subcontractor Strategem’s natural language classification tool included named entity recognition and sentiment analysis. 
The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is requiring that by 2022 all government records be created, retained, and managed in electronic formats with appropriate metadata. Compounded by records creep in SharePoint and MS Teams, especially during COVID telework restrictions, the work to be done out-paces what staff government-wide can accomplish. LinQuest is extending our original prototype to demonstrate that our microservice-based application has the ability to sort a collection of ten thousand government records into their appropriate Records Control Schedules (B-RCS) bucket categories. Our solution, once fully trained, will leverage two machine learning approaches, and will use the output of both to make a final categorization choice of B-RCS bucket given a document. The first approach uses unsupervised (unlabeled) document clustering via Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) followed by a multilayer perceptron classifier based on the B-RCS labels. The second approach takes advantage of the enormous leaps in pretrained language transformers, namely BERT, and sophisticated classification libraries that make sense of sentence meanings in suggesting bucket categories. The advantage of the former approach is its ability to train on a large number of words present in each document, while the latter approach is limited in the number of document sentences that can be included in the analysis. By combining the approaches using an additional neural network, we harness the best of each technique.

 
4.	LinQuest Enterprise Analytics Document Search (LEADS) LEADS is an IR&D project to build a document-searching prototype for internal business reflection.  We use named entity recognition (NER) to identify, classify, and tag entities in unstructured text.   We are using machine learning and data science entity extraction techniques to create actionable Business Intelligence based on examining technical approaches, win/loss analysis and synthesizing noisy data from intelligence, find structure, patterns, and relationships to make decisions. Using LEADS, the business development organization will be able to map capture targets based on budget data and technical capabilities, complete competitive analyses around target opportunities, and rely on sentiment analyses and topic generation for proposal support.  Other applications include analyzing Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) data sets from telemetry feeds to identify anomalous data to move from human, to computer-assisted decisions to autonomous decisions. 
  
LEADS is a data processing pipeline for real-time structured and unstructured data at scale.  Built upon an Apache Pulsar-based distributed messaging architecture with a robust Elasticsearch capability at the core, LEADS derives actionable intelligence from disparate sources of data using a variety of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques.

LEADS Data Discovery services crawls local network and internet data repositories, starting from defined sources and reaching out into open source areas seeking to identify and process new data elements related to its mission tasking.  Mission tasking is set by an ontology-based parameters that define a particular set of requirements.

As new documents and data sources are discovered, the LEADS real-time data-processing engine ingests these data and runs them through a robust set of classification models and machine learning algorithms before storing them in the NoSQL database Cassandra or the RDBMS PostgreSQL as appropriate.  These datasets are then indexed into a primary and secondary search indices and made available through the Elasticsearch engine.

LEADS depends on a variety of advanced techniques such as Faceted Classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and Link Analysis.

Advanced Techniques
Faceted Classification
Faceted search is a technique which involves augmenting traditional search techniques with a faceted navigation system, allowing users to narrow down search results by applying multiple filters based on faceted classification of the items. A faceted classification system classifies each information element along multiple explicit dimensions, called facets, enabling the classifications to be accessed and ordered in multiple ways rather than in a single, pre-determined, taxonomic order.
Named Entity Recognition
Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entity mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
In natural language processing, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar. For example, if observations are words collected into documents, it posits that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each word's presence is attributable to one of the document's topics. LDA is an example of a topic model and belongs to the machine learning toolbox and in wider sense to the artificial intelligence toolbox.
Link Analysis
Link Analysis is used to identify relationships between named entities (nodes).  Knowledge discovery through link analysis identifies patterns in disparate data that would otherwise prove difficult to discern.


5.	Harness for Adaptive Learning (HAL) HAL combines automated MS&A environment, ML, and distributed computation power to automatically run simulation tools from physics to mission planning. HAL is a machine learning software platform for efficient sampling, meta-modeling, and understanding of complex systems/models. HAL “harnesses” a target model without the need to access its internal design, treating it as “black box.” Using a variety of experimental design techniques, algorithms, and sampling agents to generate inputs to the black box model and observe its outputs, HAL autonomously builds a highly accurate meta-model representation of the target model.  These meta-models become fast-running surrogates for the original complex model, enabling more rapid evaluation and understanding of the relevant design space and significantly reducing the time and human involvement required to characterize, navigate, and understand complex systems, operational contexts, and modeling environments. Through efficient initial sampling, meta-model construction, adaptive sampling, and interactive data exploration, users are able to analyze complex and high interest threat systems and mission areas.  HAL harnesses models and simulations of various scope and fidelity across all levels of the military M&S pyramid and offers overall understanding of entire design spaces.  HAL has been shown to reduce the time and human involvement needed to characterize, navigate, and understand the complexity of black-box systems and modeling environments.  In 2020, LinQuest developed a point-and-click user interface for customers to connect via API to connect to harness scripting capability.  


6.	Commercial/Sports Market We built a platform that provides real-time analytical tools to support over five million online users participating in daily fantasy and betting games. The algorithm analyzes historical game data elements to determine the optimal lineup.  The AWS platform maintains data on MLB, NFL, NHL, NBA, NCCAF, and NCAAM and updates nearly 100 data elements on a near real-times basis such as depth charts, refs, weather, injuries, etc.  The ‘product’ supports a US major media company by providing white-labeled sports services for their customer base.  The platform provides games predictions based on AI/ML algorithms among other related capabilities to the sports user. We could build a product for DoD to make similar predictions based on historical events; for example predicting who would be a good recruit.

We can help you manage and automate any step of your data/machine learning pipeline or the entire pipeline.
Question Formulation and Stating the Hypothesis
The very first step in any machine learning project is formulating the question and stating what the hypothesis that will be tested or what results are sought and what predictive capabilities are sought from the machine learning model that will ultimately be deployed to production. As this step involved close working knowledge of the business, we work closely with the customer to determine what questions they seek to answer or predictions they seek to make using their data assets.

Data Extraction and Engineering
Data extraction involves sourcing the relevant data from different data sources for the ML task in question. The most crucial part of this step is to ensure the following
Is there data available that answers thq question being asked?
Where is that data located?
How can that data be accessed?
Data Cleaning and Sanitization 
Data cleaning involved the process of cleaning up the data and looking for and addressing all or some of the following problems that exist in raw data sets.

Data Duplication
Null and empty value removal
Incorrect data format
Missing data points or features

In this step, we prepare the data for the machine learning tasks at hand including splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets. You also apply data transformations and feature engineering to the model that solves the target task.


Data Visualization and Analysis
We perform exploratory data analysis on the data set to summarize the main characteristics with visual methods and/or using statistical models. This also involves
Understanding/exploring the schema and characteristics of the data that are expected by the model..
Identifying and preparing the data as well as engineering features that are needed for the model.

Model Generation and Evaluation
We implement different algorithms with the prepared data to train various ML models. In addition, we subject the implemented algorithms to hyperparameter tuning to get the best performing ML model. The output of this step is a trained model.
 The model is evaluated on a test set to evaluate the model quality. The output of this step is a set of metrics to assess the quality of the model.
The model is then confirmed to be adequate for deployment—that its predictive performance is better than the baseline established by the existing model.
 

Model Deployment
Model serving: The validated model is deployed to a target environment to serve predictions. This deployment can be one of the following:
Microservices with a REST API to serve online predictions.
An embedded model to an edge or mobile device.
Part of a batch prediction system.

Model Monitoring
As new data is constantly becoming available, we continuously monitor the model for its predictive ability and to determine whether a new baseline or a new model deployment is necessary.

Monitoring lets you detect performance degradation and model staleness. It acts as a cue to a new experimentation iteration and retraining of the model on new data.

It was scalable, machine driven way for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to identify entries that have a high potential of being improper claims. It removes sampling bias, human error/fatigue, etc. This is important for program integrity, because flagging improper payments before they get paid results in tighter financial control. By analyzing claims before payments are made, numerous improper payments can be avoided, saving a substantial amount of money and time for CMS. We ran unsupervised machine learning algorithms from Spark MLlib libraries and Python libraries on SNF data from CMS ResDAC. All of this was done in our AWS cloud, then submitted via White Paper to CMS.

Unfortunately, with the volume of raw data currently available, critical information often goes unnoticed and or under-utilized, especially in terms of video data where there are simply not enough people to screen hours of uneventful video hoping that they eventually find useful content. Video Quotient® (VQ®) was built to solve this problem and provide actionable intelligence at the speed events are occurring using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and a massively parallelized data processing architecture. The program has the capability to watch thousands of videos and subsequently alert users when events or people of interest appear. VQ is able to track people and vehicles and find data patterns over time, such as changes to the flow of traffic or if a person is entering an area that has been quarantined off. VQ’s configurable architecture allows for rapid integration of existing or custom analytics, and Parsons has built a team of industry-leading Data Scientists ready to build analytics tailored to your specific needs. Additionally, the program supports the integration of third-party analytics, allowing you to seamlessly take advantage of analytics from both Parsons’ commercial partners and the open-source community. VQ® integrates directly into your existing architecture, leveraging all existing cameras and infrastructure you have already invested in but providing useful insights into previously unusable data. VQ® has been used across the Department of Defense as one of their premier video analytics platforms.

Charybdis

Charybdis is a metrics library used in the test and evaluation of computer vision algorithms. Charybdis can calculate a growing number of metrics, including precision, recall, mean average precision, F1, F-beta, track fragmentation, average track accuracy (ATA), sequence frame detection accuracy (SFDA), track dissociation, ATAg. Charybdis can be integrated with data repositories to enable execution on large datasets. The results from Charybdis can be used to compare algorithms as they evolve over time, and between different competing algorithms to make deployment decisions. Charybdis currently functions on a broad set of imagery types including Full Motion Video, Wide Area Motion Video, satellite imagery, and face detection/recognition. It includes capabilities to make the process as automated as possible, requiring minimum human interaction and automatically producing a detailed and insightful report. Charybdis is planned to evolve to include additional non-computer vision data types such as natural language processing.


Protracked

Protracked is an algorithm that can bolt on to MORSE's or any other vendor's computer vision detection algorithm. Protracked implements a Kalman Filter with Hungarian matching to improve tracking performance. From previous testing, Protracked has demonstrated an improvement in track fragmentation to less than 1 fragment per minute.


DVA (Deep Vision Automation)

DVA is an AI-assisted labeling utility to dramatically increase the speed of data labeling, which then can be used for algorithm training. Training AI/ML algorithms takes a vast amount of training data, and producing this labeled data is very costly and time consuming. DVA uses a detector to automatically label objects of interest. Although no detector is perfect, reviewing and correcting the labels from the detector is significantly faster than creating labels from scratch. DVA includes a web portal that makes it easier for a labeler to select the data to label, run the detector, and review and potentially correct results. DVA has demonstrated the ability to speed up labeler performance by 100x.


Themis

Themis is an AI algorithm test and evaluation harness including data management capabilities. Themis functions with a growing variety of different types of algorithms including computer vision and predictive analysis. Themis defines a common containerized interface standard to which vendors can adhere. Vendors can directly upload their algorithms to the Themis web portal, verify compliance with the interface standard, run against test data, and visually display metrics results. Themis focuses on automating as much as possible to reduce the burden of integration. Themis has been used on some programs to cut down a typically month-long integration and test process into hours.


Platypus

Platypus is a real-time algorithm ensembler that fuses the outputs of multiple real-time computer vision tracking algorithms, leveraging individual strengths and attenuating weaknesses, resulting in an output that is more performant than any of of the individual algorithms. Platypus uses an internal algorithm to analyze the relationship of metadata (time of day, slant angle, etc) to determine the environments in which a particular algorithm combination will perform the best. Platypus demonstrated a 4-point improvement to F1 score while maintaining track fragmentation, when utilized with a combination of already-high-performing vendor algorithms.


Reasoning

Reasoning is a set of utilities that analyzes computer vision detections to make higher-level inferences more useful for an analyst. Reasoning contains a suite of algorithms that use statistical, data fusion, supervised ML, and unsupervised ML techniques to determine anomalous behavior. Reasoning algorithms can perform all of the following: detect speed anomalies on individual vehicles; detect traffic jam events and anomalies; detect erratic driving, associate object interactions (e.g., person entering a vehicle); create road networks from vehicle detections; and overlay anomalies on WAMI imagery. The reasoning algorithms and capabilities are under continuous development.


Burrito

Burrito is a real-time software framework that uses a modular, layered approach to manage and coordinate the execution of algorithms in a variety of environments including those that are resource constrained. Burrito includes distinctly separate and modular layers for input, data manipulation, algorithm execution, data formatting, and output. This architecture allows for rapidly tailoring Burrito for different environments, use cases, and data types. Burrito respects timing constraints and enforces non-blocking graceful handling of timing overruns.

By storing data in column-based tables in main memory and bringing online analytical processing (OLAP) and online transactional processing (OLTP) together, SAP HANA is unique – and significantly faster than other database management systems (DBMS) on the market today.
 
SAP HANA provides embedded predictive and machine learning algorithms and connectors (R and TensorFlow) directly in SAP HANA.  This enables applications and analytics such as SAP Analytics Cloud to execute predictive analytics on live data with moving the data to another predictive or machine learning platform.  
 
The SAP HANA predictive analysis library (PAL) comprises native procedures to address classic predictive and machine learning scenarios, encompassing the algorithm categories of classification, regression, cluster analysis, time series analysis, association analysis, social network analysis, recommender systems as well as data pre-processing and statistics. SAP HANA Automated Predictive Library (APL) allows business users, who don't have to be experienced data scientists, to create, deploy, and maintain predictive models for classification, regression, clustering, time series forecast, recommendation, or social network analysis. The External Machine Learning Library (EML) lets you integrate an external machine learning framework (TensorFlow) with SAP HANA. Integration of the SAP HANA database with R allows you to use the R environment for specific statistical functions.  SAP HANA native SQL Store Procedures to operationalize AI and ML.  Additionally, Data Scientist can develop leverage Python to develop analytics leveraging the HANA Machine Learning Client Libraries API (hana_ml).  
 
SAP Data Intelligence also leverages HANA ML to delegate algorithms to run in HANA and can execute any HANA predictive function from the Data Intelligence pipeline.

technologies to enable these capabilities. This includes leveraging AI
technology paired with human-in-the-loop decision making and feedback
to augment and make operations more efficient and extend the life of the
asset in place while optimizing the overall performance related to
production. Leveraging data streamed off of the asset we augment
decision making process by identifying operational states of the asset and
identify when remediation activities should be performed. By leveraging a
suite of anomaly detection techniques and operational mode clustering we
are able to not only predict in advance when a failure will occur, we are
also able to describe why that prediction is being made and what are the
contributing factors. This enables a human to make judgement for the
remedial actions and codify those actions in the system. This codification
enables predictive maintenance capabilities allowing for continuous
learning of the system and enables the automation of maintenance
procedures. The platform is extensible and can be leveraged beyond the
base targeted scenario.
The SparkPredict platform is a fully scalable and extensible solution that
allows for adaptations of the base application with other systems and use
cases. This flexibility is provided via an “API first approach” allowing for
every component, prediction, recommendation and alert to be securely
accessed by any external system. This allows for the solution to adapt and
evolve as your needs and use case changes.
SparkPredict by design is configured to be able to connect anything.
SparkPredict’s full open API architecture allows it to connect any low level
protocol all the way up to big data aggregation applications. This flexibility allows for adapters and connectors to be delivered and extended with a
continuously expanding library of connectors.","Natural Language Processing,Neural Networks,Machine Learning,Predictive Analytics,Prescriptive Analytics,Data Aggregation/Assimilation/Visualization,Robotic Process Automation,AI Platform/Framework Tool",,"Corporate Users,Data Scientists,Value Added Resellers,Academics Users,Government Users",,"Subscription license,Perpetual license",,10 - 100,Commercial/proprietary,Yes,,Yes,"In-person, onsite training for a fee,Online training/webinars for a fee",,Low (1 - 5 days),None (< 1 day),No,No,,"Data Engineer,DevOps Engineer","DevOps Engineer,Systems Administrator",Online web pages/books,,,,"Department of Defense,Department of Energy",https://www.sparkcognition.com/three-cases-artificial-intelligence-overcoming-professional-bias/?utm_source=www.google.com&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=Google&referrer-analytics=1,No,Yes,Feature importance per prediction,,,,,"2020 CB Insights 100 most innovative startups, Cybersecurity Excellence Awards (2019), Best Product for End Point Security Cyber Defense Magazine (2019)",F_2TGVXeM1gC3ar6X,Solutions-Catalog_SCE-CAT-1D-121820.pdf,3583125,application/pdf,"SparkCognition’s deep learning-based products are agile and can streamline operations of any size, making it easier to accomplish goals and meet objectives in an expedited manner.

The product affords capabilities that include database design, data exploration and visualization, integration with existing software, customization, and the formulation of user-specific dashboards. It meets NIST/FedRAMP, Section 508, Data Act, and CMS style guidelines. Revelo can be hosted within partner FedRAMP environments such as Rackspace and IBM. Within hosted environments, Revelo can be incorporated into a single sign on environment. Revelo operationalizes Optimal’s Real-Time Framework, an approach that allows for simultaneous data collection, analysis, and reporting while emphasizing continuous, rapid-cycle feedback.

Automating the process of identifying firms for solicitations, Optimal’s government procurement decision support tool serves as a use case and module of Revelo. Aimed at lessening burdens faced by procurement officials and reducing implicit and explicit biases in the procurement process, the tool leverages a series of deep learning algorithms to support a data-driven recommender system. In doing so, the tool uses administrative data from the System for Award Management (SAM) and the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS).

The tool allows contracting officers to make more rapid, valid, equitable, and evidence-based sources sought and award decisions. Additionally, the tool allows users to identify whether and which small, veteran owned, minority owned, and other disadvantaged firms have the capabilities to fulfill certain procurement requirements. For business owners, the tool affords ease in identifying and ranking the chances of being deemed qualified for specific solicitations.

By leaning on hardware, software, and data science expertise, we provide this functionality in tactical, more compact form factors than our competition while remaining scalable to larger enterprise solutions.
From a hardware perspective, the system starts with our software defined radio platform, allowing for applications ranging from the server room to the tactical edge. Our radio technology development gives this system best in class data fidelity, scalability, and a wider net to simultaneously capture and process more signals. To tackle the computationally intensive tasks required to perform real-time digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning (ML), our hardware platform is fortified with FPGA, GPU and CPU elements working in concert. This accelerated platform works in tandem with the latest in data processing and data sharing techniques, pushing the platform in performance and interoperability.
AIGSOS is…
•	Trustworthy and Verifiable AI/ML - In a world where decisions are increasingly data driven and rapid but the need for accountability is greater, AIGSOS employs visualization and reporting mechanisms in order to communicate not only what conclusions were reached, but the level of confidence and the manner by which the system came to its answers. AIGSOS uses innovative ML and customized clustering algorithms to extract knowledge form the spectrum like no other system available on the market today.
•	Force Multiplier - From the moment the system is introduced to the environment, it goes to work: automatically detecting signals, extracting them, and putting it all into a NoSQL database. Upon the introduction of signals into the database, a swarm of GPU accelerated, intelligent agents rapidly assemble the pieces needed to provide relevant decision support information. AIGSOS automatically provides decision support information such as: What RF emitters in the area? How many are there? What are they? Where are they? What modulation are they using?  What kind of data is being transported? Can a communications network be inferred from these signals’ traffic? Are there any frequency hopping signals nearby? Is a drone/UAV in the area? Where is the drone? Where is the drone’s controller? Are these adversarial peer-peer communications links? Are military voice / data radios nearby? Are there previously unknown signals in the environment? Does an unknown signal being observed have the same characteristics as one that was observed earlier?

KaaS enrichment uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to perform text analytics, entity extraction and object recognition on the incoming Multi-INT data.  The enriched information is in the form of semantic metadata, which enables advanced search and discovery over the collected information through keyword, taxonomic synonym, geospatial, temporal, data source, data type and mission-specific facet queries.  Analytical Systems wanting access to KaaS enriched and raw information can remotely define ‘topics’ using one or more of the preceding query types, and as new information is ingested, any topic matches are routed immediately to the requesting analytical system. A current project sponsored by US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L) Center is adding automating machine translation of 14 foreign languages into English.  This will allow KaaS Consumers (systems that ingest KaaS enriched information) to specify queries in English and native foreign language.  KaaS’ natural language processing engine includes diverse taxonomic hierarchies of domain synonyms that make identification and filtering of relevant information easy.  These taxonomies include ones for Terrorist Organizations, IED Components and Tactics, Weapon Systems including Chemical, Biological and Nuclear weapons, Cyber Hacker Organizations and TTPs, etc.  In each taxonomy, KaaS has a rich list of synonyms for each term.  This allows a user to search with one term that they know and automatically search for all of the synonyms for that term and any synonym of any subordinate term (and their synonyms).  
KaaS is currently deployed within Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud and Microsoft’s Azure Government clouds.  Certification and accreditation packages have been submitted for KaaS to authorize it to operate on classified networks and to use the AWS Diode (One-way Transfer) service, which allows KaaS to push open-source information to classified networks where those data can be fused with classified information.

They will think about raw compute power with NVIDIA GPUs, the latest applications for NLP, image analysis, or RPA. They will think about cloud services’ analytics tools and the fact that they require no up front investment in infrastructure to use.
 
But successful execution and use of Artificial Intelligence technology depends on data.  Many federal agency AI projects require tapping data that resides today on NetApp platforms.  
While many of these systems are engineered hardware and software systems, increasingly agencies are using NetApp cloud-based solutions for performance and efficiency, or object storage that spans both on premises and public cloud services. NetApp has over 25 year history helping customers store, protect and secure their data. This history includes innovation in simplifying data management, reducing data storage costs, and improving application performance and data access.
NetApp has a history of helping customers do more with their data.  Customers have historically reused Disaster Recovery data copies as test environments and accelerated software development and training for large enterprise applications using NetApp data cloning technology.   
 
NetApp’s AI products and solutions outlined in this response have the same goal: enable customers to do more with their data. 
 
The ability to examine raw data in detail and by location is critical for AI applications.  Raw data to be used by AI technologies must be quickly accessible and available with very high performance in order to meet the speed demands of GPUs. 
An architecture like a Data Fabric helps meet AI’s location data management challenges because it provides capabilities of fast performance, capacity, and data availability across all locations in an AI lifecycle-  including (existing) on-premises datastores,  hybrid,  and  cloud facilities.   Data  Fabric  architectures and services allow  easy  data movement and interoperability across all locations to ensure optimal data locality and AI data processing.
 
Speed is key to AI projects. In addition to compute performance, AI needs optimization  of  IO  speed  and  raw  performance.    AI  technologies  are  naturally dependent upon the infrastructure upon which they ride, and it is essential in order to meet the  speed  demands  of  today’s GPUs to  maintain very  high processing  speed  and performance.
 
Data  quality is another challenge of successful AI projects.   A Forrester study on impediments to AI technologies indicated that data quality is a key issue (in addition to talent and trust in AI systems).Repeated  testing  and ensuring  appropriate  copies and freshness of valid data can help. 
NetApp  addresses  this  with  capabilities  that  have become a defacto standard of enterprise data storage environments including the ability to snapshot and clone (point in time) copies of data.
In addition, the ability to maintain the freshness of data and data change rates of AI data baselines  is also important. For optimal efficacy, AI architecture must supportthe ability to quickly load, access, update, and refresh data to provide timely and accurate results.  For this to happen, the instant  data  ‘snapshot’ and  clone backup  and  recovery  capabilities should be  widely available across all data locations in an AI data pipeline –on-premises, hybrid cloud and cloud facilities-to allow instantaneous data processing and re-processing for more and faster AI outcomes.  
 
Flexibility is another  critical requirement  to  support AI  project success,  and  so NetApp does not offer purpose-built solutions.  NetApp enables agencies toupdate, expand, and grow the overall system, extending existing investments, data sets, and capabilities without disruption while maintaining common data management practices. 
 
Ensuring  appropriate  and  reliable  security is  a  cornerstone  of the Federal Data strategy and recommended action plan.  AI architectures and platforms must support the ability to secure data through encryption and proper key management across an AI data pipeline, and for these security features to  be built in to platforms rather than requiring add-on products and services.   NetApp has a long history of delivering data security built into our platforms (hardware and software and now cloud and container-based) to meet security needs no matter what application is using the data.
 
Pre-tested  and  validated  solutions help optimize  AI  deployment  in  the Federal Government in particular.  Solutions presented here like ONTAP AI and FlexPod AI enable agencies to focus on the  data  and outcomes  versus  the  infrastructure,  minimize  deployment  risks,  and accelerate delivery/implementation time.  IT modernization doesn’t always mean replacing infrastructure with a shiny new technology.  Often these platforms can deliver more value to agencies because they can be cloud-connected or extended with a new AI application without asking agencies to change how they manage their data. NetApp has taken this a step further with the AI Control Plane and Data Science Toolkit. These offerings combine the best of commercial data management with the latest open source tools to let data scientists and engineers use the data storage platforms they have without having to learn the nuts and bolts of managing them.
 
Acquisition and provisioning infrastructure to support AI can also present a challenge to fast moving projects.  Cloud services simplify and accelerate infrastructure access and provisioning. NetApp embraces this change and provides not only cloud-based versions of our enterprise storage and data management but AI as a Service with partners like Equinix and NVIDIA and Core Scientific to let data scientists experiment without worrying about infrastructure build out (cloud or otherwise). 
Finally, NetApp and partner led workshops help agencies plan their projects, taking into consideration existing investments and IT talent.
 
We appreciate the opportunity to share how NetApp fits into AI and ML projects with this market survey. We welcome conversations with the GSA AI CoE and others to share how NetApp continues to help agencies use their data and their IT investments in new ways.

These decisions are interpretable and explainable to different degrees - it’s not actually a question of black box or white box, but many shades of grey.  However, we may need to trade off predictive power to improve interpretability and explainability, hence the elevation as a first-class concern.   Interpretable means people can reason about a model’s decision-making process in general terms while, explainable means people can understand the factors that led to a specific decision. People are important in this definition - a data scientist may be satisfied with the explanation that the model minimizes total loss, while a declined credit applicant probably requires a reason code.   And those two extremes can anchor our explainability spectrum - at one end we can explain a result as a general consequence of minimizing loss, at the other end explaining the specific factors that contributed to an individual decision.  As core modelling concerns, we should consider: ●	The choice of modelling technique as intrinsically explainable ●	Model specific or agnostic explainability techniques ●	Whether global or just local interpretability is required  A decision tree or linear regression is intrinsically explainable - factors contribute sequentially or linearly to a decision. A generic neural network is not. However, in between we can use techniques such as embeddings, latent spaces or transfer learning, which create representations of inputs that are distinct, but not necessarily in human terms.  Model specific explainability relies on the modelling technique, be that the gradient of a linear model, or thresholds and sequence of a decision tree. Model agnostic techniques are instead empirical. We can create surrogate explainable models for any given model, and we can use ablation to explore the effect of changing inputs on a model’s decisions.  For a given decision, we might only wish to understand how that decision would have been different had the inputs changed. In this case we are only concerned about local interpretability, and LIME is an effective technique.  As broader business concerns, we should consider: ●	Are we compliant to local laws, and are we acting ethically? (More on ethical bias testing here.) ●	There remains a risk of unseen data if the model is not intrinsically explainable - either outside or within the original distribution depending on the degree of non-linearity ●	Knowledge management is important - an interpretable model, such as the Glasgow Coma Scale, may valued more for people’s ability to use it than its pure predictive performance ●	And finally, models can always make mistakes, so a challenge process must be considered, especially as vulnerable people are disproportionately subject to automated decision making  So model explainability should be a first class concern, and we have many tools at our disposal.",F_UxRoIgTrS64ghG1,ThoughtWorks - Materials describing your company's approach to xAI.docx,13408,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,,F_3M9UMFc03QqzceK,ThoughtWorks white papers or documents on AI.docx,14252,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,"We are Agile native with two ThoughtWorkers being co-authors of the Agile Manifesto.

VESPR is an end-to-end solution for algorithmic transparency and reliability. Providing users with the fundamental tools and advanced testing capabilities with a streamlined workflow, VESPR  ensures that every machine learning algorithm put into production has been forged and tested using a battery of traditional and non-traditional tests. As VESPR continues to mature for the needs of production, organizations will benefit from enhanced visibility and accountability, with clear insight into the workings of all algorithms in use. 

VESPR's workflow simplifies the overall process while improving security, giving data scientists the ability to create and deploy secure algorithms. In the backend, VESPR conducts a battery of tests for verification and validation.

The most important feature within VESPR is the Verification and Validation stage (V&V). V&V offers metrics on the algorithm robustness, demonstrates the current configuration relative to ideal configurations, and enables the user to conduct additional testing. This feature establishes clear metrics for algorithmic performance prior to the deployment of the algorithm into a production environment, reducing risks.

This causes challenges with trusting an AI’s security, robustness, and performance, and results in degraded capabilities and technological utility for the U.S. Government. Current challenges around AI include validation (does the model do what is intended) explainability (how does the AI model work) and robustness (is the AI model secure from attack or error). These challenges present barriers to technological adoption and deployment and ultimately lead to reduced U.S. Government capabilities. Complicating these challenges is the current skills gap across the national security workforce in advanced data science, machine learning (including adversarial machine learning), and artificial intelligence.

At most industrial companies, available data is often out of date, incomplete, and stored in disparate tools across organizations, creating silos that give an incomplete view of business operations. Historically, applying data science has mainly been restricted to technical users. These users often have access to just a subset of the available data, lacking the context to more significant data environments and subsequent business knowledge. Due to nuances and hierarchical complexities of industrial data, such users often spend as much as 80% of their time preparing and transforming data before a single data science model can be built and deployed.
The Uptake Platform addresses this siloed and inefficient workflow, taking data from assets, work orders, enterprise systems, and curated sources focused on delivering valuable insights. It enables Uptake and its customers to create insights that drive financial outcomes in minutes or hours, rather than days.

− API – Azure Topic – SFTP
− Amazon S3 – Azure Queue – Kafka Topic
− MQTT Topic – Box
Other customized connections that are not currently in our library can be built out on an
as-needed basis. We also routinely work with IoT (PI, OPC, Backnet), MES, and work
order systems on both inbound and outbound connectivity. Uptake will work closely with
Alcoa's IT teams to streamline ingestion of data to ensure any gaps are addressed
holistically. Close collaboration with the Operations and Business teams is also critical

--------------------
The Challenge: Market research, a necessity of acquisition planning, helps ensure federal clients’ needs are met in an effective, timely, and cost-effective manner. However, most agencies don’t have a standard process for conducting market research, leading to ad hoc and highly manual methods. Because the process isn’t standardized, the inconsistency prevents agencies from exhaustively searching and fully vetting their service management options. Considering how important market research is, the processes need to be improved to enable agencies to follow the most suitable approach for acquiring, distributing, and supporting products and services.

The Solution: To save our clients time and money, Savan Group has developed the Market Research Knowledge Tool by leveraging robotic process automation and artificial intelligence tools and techniques. The tool automates key aspects of the market research processes by using user-defined criteria, enabling acquisitions and program staff to focus on higher value work.

eComment Toolkit
------------------------

The Challenge: The government is under increasing pressure to make actionable decisions based on data gathered during the public comment process. This process can generate an overwhelming number of comments. Manual comment review methods are costly and time consuming. The government requires rapid delivery of analytics to support the decision process.

The Solution: Savan Group developed the eComment Toolkit to analyze comments for a variety of actionable data—chiefly, identifying position, sentiment, recommendations, and trending topics; and deduplicating form-letter responses. The tool also identifies and clusters bot-generated responses and patterns that would typically be impossible for humans to identify. The result is a graphical analysis that distills the data to allow clients to make the actionable decisions about proposed rules.

Intelligent Records Consolidation Tool (IRCT)
-----------------------
The Challenge: Government records control schedules are often outdated, large, difficult to use, and would benefit from consolidation either on a functional or thematic level.

The Solution: Savan Group’s IRCT leverages natural language processing to identify schedule items that are semantically similar to other ones, creating opportunities for consolidation. Properly consolidated schedules increase use and understanding, saving both time and money.

This layer of the software coordinates a suite of modular AI/ML algorithms, allowing users to take advantage of multiple algorithms and analytics within a single interface.  Additionally, this layer helps users choose between alternatives, through recommendations or “smart” analytics. The orchestration layer involves both front-end and back-end coordination which appears seamless to the user. On the front-end, the orchestration empowers users with a choice among available algorithms/analytics. On the back-end, the system enables access to a variety of data sources and analytic platforms within the user’s existing AI/ML environment.

TWX employs a combination of expertise to classify, clean, label, analyze, visualize, and present data for both technical and non-technical users.  These efforts include clustering, regression, classification, graph analysis, text summarization, and both supervised and unsupervised learning. TWX has also demonstrated proficiency with a range of current AI/ML technologies including Hadoop, Spark, Scala, Python, R, and TensorFlow.

To uphold this commitment, in 2019, Mastercard announced the Data Responsibility Imperative (link below) which is based on the fundamental beliefs that individuals should own and control their data, and that they should benefit from its use while their privacy is being fully protected. These beliefs are upheld by Mastercard's Data Responsibility Principles (link below)  to which we hold ourselves accountable. The principles provide a framework for responsible, human-centered innovation with data by placing individuals at the center of everything we do. To operationalize the Data Responsibility principles in our design, development, and application of AI, we established AI Governance which promotes trustworthy and ethical AI, guarding individuals against data and AI misuse, bias and misinformation. Mastercard’s AI Governance includes executive oversight and requirements to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, as well as deliberate steps to identify and mitigate potential bias to protect individuals from unintended and discriminatory outcomes.   As part of this requirement, Mastercard seeks to ensure that solution outcomes do not have a negative differential impact on individuals based on sensitive attributes, such as gender, ethnicity, age, familial status, so on. To achieve the above, deliberate steps to preserve solution integrity and mitigate potential bias include: •	Understanding how the input data was generated – having a good understanding of data provenance and data lineage is particularly important when using historical data. •	Properly framing the business problem and assessing the data against it – understanding if the input data is fit for the purpose and making sure it is of high quality and representative of the production population and/or context. •	Identifying and mitigating potential bias – prior to model development, analyzing and understanding input data and relationships among variables to identify and mitigate potential bias; post-model development, outcomes are evaluated for potential bias by comparing outcome distributions across protected categories. •	Preventing differential impact in the outcomes of individually impactful solutions – prior to taking any actions based on model outputs, ensuring that fairness criteria are satisfied according to local standards, including those promulgated by policymakers and regulators. Examples of fairness criteria include:  30.	Demographic Parity: Requires that the decision is independent of the sensitive attribute; implies decision must be proportionally the same across protected categories  31.	Equalized Odds: Requires that the decision is independent of the sensitive attribute conditioned on the actual outcome; implies equalized error rates across protected categories 32.	Calibration: Requires that the actual outcome is independent of the sensitive attribute conditioned on the decision; implies equalized proportion of good predictions across protected categories  Data Responsibility and Principles: https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/vision/corp-responsibility/data-responsibility.html",Yes,All the AI models built have the features that contribute to their decisioning which can be used to explain the reasoning behind the decision making.,F_3mkHeq2t2NXKrIZ,Mastercards AI Governance.pdf,203551,application/pdf,"AI/ML is and continues to be deployed in to many of Mastercard's products and solutions.

Hello,

I was planning to provide several more slide decks, data sheets and WP's that speak to Mastercard's AI/ML product capability, however it seems the upload box in the question above is only set up to receive 1 document (every time I attempt to upload a second document it appears to just be rewriting the first). Will there be an opportunity to provide these? Will these be accepted via email?

Thank you for allowing Mastercard an opportunity to speak to it's AI/ML capability. We look forward to providing more information and having future discussions around this topic.

The AI solutions Booz Allen delivers to clients is capable of explaining their outputs. Booz Allen has taken a number of approaches to ensure our AI solutions can be explained to both technical practitioners as well as a third-party auditor. Each of these approaches creates a usable mapping from the model output back to the input variables that had the greatest influence in the prediction. This mapping can then be converted into any format that best suits the needs of the work (e.g., formatting for human analysis may require digital dashboard or generation of a printable document; whereas, formatting for use in a downstream automated system may require additional considerations). We, at Booz Allen, believe stakeholders want to know what a prediction means and what to do about it. To this end, instead of simply providing AI model recommendations, our products and services strive to provide clear-language descriptions of the characteristics of that AI model’s recommendation and the extent to which input variables have contributed to that recommendation.   One approach is Booz Allen’s partnership with industry partners that specialize in explaining AI outputs for specific industries or use-cases. Booz Allen also utilizes best-in-breed explainability COTS and open-source software offerings. Booz Allen also has the in-house expertise to develop custom explainability capabilities as needed by the client.

Our AI platform has a unique and automated method of categorizing content not by keyword but by multi-dimensional concept maps. These maps include context and feature vectors, which means that the map is more accurate and superior to a human manufactured taxonomy. As new content is created, the Enterprise Brain is continuously updated and improved, automatically integrating and categorizing this content to become an enduring repository of knowledge. 

The Enterprise Brain dramatically reduces costs and increases efficiencies by automating data tasks for using proven machine learning. Our machine learning team can help you 

achieve a deeper, more dynamic interaction with your data: 

• Learn and map organizational knowledge across multiple systems 

• Automate tasks and processes 

• Enable easier access to information 

• Improve knowledge collaboration 

 

Dynamic, animated personas (APs) help organizations gather a deep understanding of internal and external customers. Our unique APs allow you to create simulated employees and numerous categories of segmented users. Using machine learning, the personas will help you gain insight on how each customer segment will react to a product, service or message and predict future reactions as the personas develop. It can simulate a population where ideas can be tested at a fraction of the cost. 

For training purposes, we leverage both supervised, and unsupervised methodologies, depending on the available data feeds and desired outcomes. We develop new models based on demographics, interests, personality, sentiment, and behavior choice data. The greater the amount of data, the more developed and accurate our Brain becomes. Depending on the nature of the desired use case, we can leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search, Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM), utility systems with Markov models, n-grams, and influence maps. For content generation and classification our research and development teams utilize Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Generative Adversarial networks (GAN), and K-means clustering. For optimization tasks, we integrate hill-climbing, gradient descent, and genetic algorithms depending on the requirements. We utilize adversarial search and planning algorithms such as minimax and alpha-beta pruning and classification techniques such as perceptions, neural networks, and support vector machines depending on the requirements.

The ‘platform’ paradigm is due to its interoperability with many-to-all other AI/ML solution. 
As noted in section 3.2, AyasdiAI's TDA technology fully interoperates with all BI and AI/ML tools, software, platforms, and companies. It is an open architecture based on Restful services that can integrate with ETL tools for data ingestion and export results to other data visualization engines for easy and rapid integration with existing baseboards and workflows. For example, AyasdiAI and Tableau reside together in many engagements, as AyasdiAI's TDA performs unsupervised machine learning and certain 'heavy lifting' analytics, classifications, and segmentations that can be reported-on and viewed-in Tableau's user interfaces and dashboards. This is also true with Qlik, SAS, and Palantir, to name a few; AyasdiAI makes these tools better with high dimensional data and enhanced graphical representations of data.

In our case, AI is a category of technology and technology is governed by our personnel policy.  With that said, we do recognize that it is occasionally advisable to have an AI-specific policy and we, again, agree with the DoD approach found here:  https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2094085/dod-adopts-5-principles-of-artificial-intelligence-ethics/","For the operation of our business, we have mandatory employee and management training to address issues of evaluating and mitigating bias.  Within our technology stack, we are highly sensitive to the significance of bias and its presentation as a key obstacle to allowing data to speak for itself.  Our unsupervised learning technology analyzes data in an unbiased fashion that can help agencies understand how their legacy models may have instituted cases of bias they may have been unaware of previously. ",Yes,"In traditional data science, particularly in today's deep learning, datasets are converted to mathematical algorithms distributed across pre-conceived or self-organized layers which presents an opportunity for obfuscation each time the model is invoked.  With our TDA technology, we begin by graphing a complex dataset into a visualization that can be filtered by the practitioner.  The shape of this graph is unique to every dataset and yields the underlying shape inherent to the data.  By including this shape in the presentation of interpretability, our models include inherent explainability typically only found in simple statistical models.  TDA makes it possible to have explainable models that perform on par with deep neural networks.  We are aware of no other technology capable of this.
